734 A genetic program consists of a population of computer programs  represented as strings of code  which are evolved and refined through a process of natural selection and mutation inspired by the principles of evolution. The genetic program typically includes the following components:Initialization: A set of initial computer programs is generated randomly to create the initial population. Fitness evaluation: Each program in the population is evaluated based on its fitness  which is a measure of its ability to solve a specific problem or perform a specific task. Selection: Programs with higher fitness are more likely to be selected to reproduce and pass on their genetic information to the next generation. Reproduction: The selected programs are combined through crossover and mutation to generate new programs for the next generation. Termination: The evolution process is terminated when a satisfactory solution is found  or when a predetermined number of generations have been reached.
