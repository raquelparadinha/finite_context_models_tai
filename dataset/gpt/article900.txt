899 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that uses radio waves to wirelessly identify and track objects or people.  RFID systems consist of three main components: a tag or transponder  a reader or interrogator  and a backend system for processing the data. The RFID tag contains a small microchip and an antenna  which can be attached to or embedded within an object.  When the tag is exposed to radio waves from a nearby reader  it powers up and sends back a signal containing its unique identifier. RFID technology has a wide range of applications  from tracking inventory and assets in supply chain management to monitoring patients in hospitals and controlling access to secure areas.  It provides a more efficient and automated way to collect data and streamline processes  compared to manual methods such as barcode scanning.
