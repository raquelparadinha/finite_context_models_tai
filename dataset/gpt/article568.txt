567 Dot matrix printers are a type of impact printer that use a matrix of pins to print text and graphics on paper.  They were widely used in the 1980s and 1990s for printing documents  receipts  and other materials. Unlike modern inkjet and laser printers  which use a non-impact printing process  dot matrix printers work by striking a ribbon against paper to create dots that form characters and images.  The print quality of dot matrix printers is generally lower than other types of printers  but they have the advantage of being able to print on multi-part forms and other thick media. Dot matrix printers were popular in many industries because of their durability and reliability  as well as their ability to print carbon copies and other multipart forms.  They were commonly used in point-of-sale systems  inventory control systems  and other business applications. Today  dot matrix printers are less common  as they have largely been replaced by faster  more efficient printers with higher print quality.  However  they are still used in some specialized applications  such as printing receipts and invoices in certain industries.
