763 Fiber optics is a technology used in telecommunications and networking that involves the transmission of data and information over thin  flexible glass or plastic fibers.  The fibers use light to transmit signals over long distances  offering high-speed and high-bandwidth communication capabilities. In a fiber optic system  light is generated by a laser or LED and transmitted through the fiber optic cable.  The light travels through the fiber by repeatedly bouncing off the walls of the fiber  which are coated with a highly reflective material.  The light is guided through the fiber by a process called total internal reflection  which allows it to travel over long distances without significant signal loss or degradation.
