921 Optical scan is a technology used in voting systems and other applications to read and tally data from paper forms or ballots.  Optical scan systems use a specialized scanner that can read marks made on paper and convert them into digital data that can be analyzed and processed electronically. In voting systems  optical scan is often used for paper ballots.  Voters mark their choices on a paper ballot by filling in bubbles  completing arrows  or making other designated marks.  The ballots are then collected and fed through an optical scanner  which reads the marks and tallies the votes electronically.  The results can be tabulated quickly and accurately  with less potential for errors compared to manual counting. Optical scan technology can also be used in other applications  such as scanning and processing surveys  forms  and other types of paper-based data collection.  The technology can save time and reduce errors compared to manual data entry  as well as provide greater flexibility in terms of data analysis and reporting.
