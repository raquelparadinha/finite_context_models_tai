628 Streaming refers to the continuous delivery of audio or video content over the internet to a user's device  allowing the user to access and enjoy the content in real-time without having to download it first. With streaming  the content is sent in small chunks over the internet  allowing the user to start playing the content immediately while the remaining parts are being downloaded in the background.  This is in contrast to downloading a file  where the user must wait for the entire file to be downloaded before they can start playing it. Streaming is made possible by a combination of server-side technology and client-side software.  The server-side technology (often called a streaming server) is responsible for sending the content to the client in small chunks.  The client-side software (such as a web browser  media player  or mobile app) is responsible for receiving and playing the content as it arrives. Streaming is widely used for a variety of applications  including music and video services  live events  webinars  online gaming  and more.  Streaming allows for high-quality content to be delivered to a global audience in real-time  without the need for users to wait for the entire file to download.
