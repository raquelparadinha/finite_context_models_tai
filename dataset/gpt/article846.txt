845 Cyberpunk is a term that originated in the science fiction genre and refers to a subgenre of science fiction that often focuses on a dystopian future where technology has advanced to the point of becoming an integral part of society  but has also brought about significant social and cultural changes. Cyberpunk typically features protagonists who are hackers  rebels  or outcasts who use advanced technology and their skills to navigate the often corrupt and oppressive society they live in.  The genre is often characterized by a dark  gritty aesthetic  and themes of artificial intelligence  virtual reality  and the blurring of boundaries between human and machine. In recent years  cyberpunk has also become associated with a broader cultural movement that draws inspiration from the genre's themes and aesthetic.  This can include fashion  music  and other forms of art that incorporate elements of cyberpunk into their design and presentation.
