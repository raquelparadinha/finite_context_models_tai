992 Censorship refers to the suppression or control of information or ideas by an authority or group in order to prevent their dissemination or expression.  When it comes to the internet  censorship refers to the control or suppression of information that is transmitted over the internet. Censorship on the internet can take various forms.  Governments may use technical measures such as website blocking  content filtering  and IP address blocking to restrict access to certain websites or information.  They may also monitor online activities and communications to identify and punish individuals who engage in prohibited activities  such as dissent or criticism of the government. Private companies  such as social media platforms and search engines  may also engage in censorship by removing or limiting access to certain content or users based on their policies or community standards.  This is often done to prevent the spread of harmful or offensive content  such as hate speech or misinformation. Advocates of internet censorship argue that it is necessary to protect national security  public order  and social values.  They may also claim that certain types of content  such as pornography or extremist propaganda  are harmful to individuals or society and should be restricted. Critics of internet censorship argue that it infringes on freedom of expression and access to information  which are fundamental human rights.  They may also argue that censorship can be used as a tool for political control and repression  and that it can stifle creativity and innovation.
