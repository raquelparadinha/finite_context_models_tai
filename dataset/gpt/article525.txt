524 Integers are typically stored in memory as binary digits  or bits  which are either a 0 or a 1.  The size of the integer (i. e.   the number of bits used to represent it) can vary depending on the programming language and the computer architecture being used. In most modern computers  integers are typically stored using a fixed number of bits  such as 8 bits  16 bits  32 bits  or 64 bits.  The number of bits used to represent an integer determines its range of possible values.  For example  an 8-bit integer can represent values between 0 and 255  while a 32-bit integer can represent values between -2 147 483 648 and 2 147 483 647. When an integer is stored in memory  it is typically stored as a binary representation of the integer's value using a fixed number of bits.  The most significant bit (MSB) represents the sign of the integer (positive or negative)  while the remaining bits represent the magnitude of the integer. For example  consider the 8-bit integer -23.  In binary  this value is represented as 11101001.  The leftmost bit (1) represents the sign (negative)  while the remaining 7 bits (1101001) represent the magnitude of the integer (23).  When this value is stored in memory  the computer will reserve 8 bits of memory and store the binary value 11101001 at the corresponding memory address.
