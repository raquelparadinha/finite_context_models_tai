593 Scheduling multiprocessor systems refer to computer systems that have multiple processors or cores that can perform parallel processing.  These systems are designed to handle complex and resource-intensive tasks that cannot be efficiently executed on a single processor system. In a scheduling multiprocessor system  the operating system is responsible for assigning tasks or processes to different processors or cores for parallel execution.  This is done through a scheduling algorithm that determines which process should be executed by which processor at a given time. The goal of scheduling in a multiprocessor system is to optimize the use of available resources and minimize the time required to complete a given set of tasks.  There are various scheduling algorithms used in multiprocessor systems  including Round Robin  First Come First Serve  and Priority Scheduling. Multiprocessor systems are commonly used in applications such as scientific computing  data processing  and real-time systems that require high performance and reliability.  They are also used in servers  supercomputers  and high-end workstations for demanding applications such as simulation  modeling  and analysis.
