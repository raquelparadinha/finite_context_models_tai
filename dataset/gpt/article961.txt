DTP involves using specialized software to design layouts  format text  and incorporate images and other graphics into a document. With desktop publishing  designers have greater control over the appearance of their documents than with traditional typesetting methods.  They can use a variety of fonts  sizes  and colors  and add images and other visual elements to create visually appealing and informative documents.
