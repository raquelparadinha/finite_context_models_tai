792 The basic building block of a Forth program is a word  which can be either a built-in primitive word or a user-defined word.  Words are defined using a combination of other words  which are arranged in a hierarchical structure.  The stack plays a central role in Forth programming  with data being pushed onto and popped off of the stack as needed by the program. Forth programs typically consist of a series of words that are executed in a specific order.  The structure of a Forth program is often represented as a tree  with the words forming the nodes of the tree and the data flowing through the branches. Forth has a simple syntax  with words being defined using a postfix notation.  This means that the arguments to a word come after the word itself  separated by spaces.  For example  to add two numbers in Forth  you would use the following syntax:2 3 +This code pushes the numbers 2 and 3 onto the stack  and then executes the addition operation using the + word.
