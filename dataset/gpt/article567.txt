566 Typewriters are mechanical or electromechanical devices used for writing or printing text on paper.  They were commonly used for typing documents  letters  and other written materials before the advent of personal computers and printers. Typewriters were first invented in the 19th century  and they quickly became popular due to their ability to produce legible  professional-looking documents.  Early typewriters were purely mechanical  with keys that pressed inked ribbons against paper to create the desired characters.  Later models added electric power to speed up the typing process and eliminate the need for manual carriage returns. Typewriters were once a common fixture in offices  schools  and other institutions  but they have largely been replaced by digital technology.  However  some people still use typewriters for their unique aesthetic and tactile experience.  In recent years  there has been a resurgence of interest in typewriters among writers  artists  and collectors
