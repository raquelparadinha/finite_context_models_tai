586 Ruby on Rails  also known as simply Rails  is a web application framework written in the Ruby programming language.  It was created by David Heinemeier Hansson in 2004 and has since become one of the most popular web frameworks for building dynamic  database-driven web applications. Rails provides a set of conventions and tools for building web applications  including support for database migrations  model-view-controller (MVC) architecture  and a wide range of plugins and gems that extend its functionality. One of the key features of Rails is its emphasis on convention over configuration.  This means that Rails provides sensible defaults and conventions that help developers get up and running quickly without having to spend a lot of time configuring the framework.  For example  Rails provides a default directory structure for organizing files  a default database schema for storing data  and a set of naming conventions that make it easy to map between database tables and Ruby classes. Rails is also known for its focus on developer productivity  with a philosophy that emphasizes simplicity  elegance  and developer happiness.  This has made it a popular choice for startups and small businesses  as well as larger enterprises. Rails is used by many popular websites and companies  including GitHub  Shopify  Airbnb  and Basecamp.
