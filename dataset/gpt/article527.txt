526 In object-oriented programming  inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class  inheriting its properties and methods.  To illustrate this concept with an example  we can use the Microsoft Windows Dialog Box. A dialog box is a graphical user interface element that displays information to the user and prompts them for a response.  In Microsoft Windows  a dialog box is implemented as a class  which we can call the DialogBox class. Now  let's suppose we want to create a new type of dialog box called a ColorPickerDialogBox that allows the user to pick a color.  We can use inheritance to create this new class based on the DialogBox class. The ColorPickerDialogBox class will inherit all the properties and methods of the DialogBox class  such as the ability to display text  buttons  and input fields.  However  the ColorPickerDialogBox class will also have its own unique properties and methods that are specific to picking colors  such as a color palette and color preview box. By using inheritance  we can avoid duplicating code and make our program more efficient and easier to maintain.  We can also create more specialized classes that build upon existing classes  making our code more modular and extensible.
