1004 Client-server computing is a model of distributed computing where tasks are divided between clients and servers.  In this model  a client is a computer or device that requests data or services from a server  which is a computer or device that provides the data or services requested by the client. The client-server model is widely used in computer networks and the internet to provide a wide range of services  such as email  web browsing  file sharing  and database access.  The model allows multiple clients to access a centralized resource or service  which can be more efficient and cost-effective than having each client perform the same task independently. In a client-server architecture  the client typically sends a request to the server  which processes the request and returns the requested data or service to the client.  The server may also be responsible for managing data storage  security  and other aspects of the service being provided.
