904 A script kiddie is an inexperienced hacker who uses pre-made software tools to carry out attacks on computer systems or networks.  They lack the skills and knowledge required to develop their own hacking tools or write their own code.  They are often motivated by a desire for peer recognition and may engage in activities such as defacing websites or launching denial-of-service attacks.  Although considered a nuisance  their actions can still cause damage or disruption.
