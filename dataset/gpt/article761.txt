760 Fault tolerance is the ability of a system or component to continue functioning in the event of a failure or malfunction of one or more of its components.  In other words  a fault-tolerant system is designed to maintain a certain level of functionality and availability even when one or more components fail. Fault tolerance is important in many areas of computing  including hardware  software  and networks.  Examples of fault-tolerant systems include redundant power supplies in a data center  backup servers and storage systems  and network failover mechanisms.
