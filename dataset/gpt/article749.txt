748 JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a file format used to store and display digital images  especially photographs.  It was developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and has become one of the most widely used image formats in the world. JPEG files use a lossy compression method  which means that some of the image data is discarded in order to reduce the file size.  This can result in some loss of image quality  especially when the compression level is high.
