865 An extranet is a private network that allows authorized external users to access a company's internal network resources over the internet. An extranet typically uses the same technology as the internet  such as web browsers and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  but provides secure access to specific resources that are not publicly available.  Examples of resources that can be accessed through an extranet include databases  applications  and documents. Extranets are commonly used by businesses to collaborate with partners  customers  and suppliers in a secure and controlled manner.  By providing authorized external users with access to specific resources  businesses can improve communication and streamline workflows  while maintaining control over sensitive data and intellectual property. Overall  extranets are a valuable tool for businesses that need to share information and collaborate with external partners  while maintaining the security and privacy of their internal network resources.
