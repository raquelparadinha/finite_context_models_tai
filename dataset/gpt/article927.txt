926 Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a secret code or cipher  so that only authorized individuals or systems can access and interpret the information.  Encryption is used to protect sensitive information  such as personal data  financial information  or confidential communications  from unauthorized access or interception. Encryption works by using an algorithm or mathematical formula to transform the original data into a code or cipher  called ciphertext.  The encryption process typically involves a secret key or password that is used to scramble the data  and only authorized individuals or systems with the corresponding key or password can decrypt the ciphertext and access the original data.
