738 Globalization is the process of increased interconnectedness and integration of the world's economies  societies  and cultures.  It refers to the growing interdependence of nations  as they become more connected through trade  investment  communication  and migration.  Globalization has been driven by a combination of technological  economic  political  and social factors  and has had profound effects on virtually every aspect of life. The phenomenon of globalization has been accelerating since the latter half of the 20th century  as advances in technology  transportation  and communication have made it easier and cheaper to connect people and businesses across borders.  As a result  goods  services  capital  and ideas can move more freely and easily than ever before  leading to increased economic growth and opportunity  as well as new challenges and risks.
