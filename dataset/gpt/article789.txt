788 A floppy disk is a type of magnetic storage device that was widely used in the late 20th century to store and transfer data between computers.  Floppy disks were first introduced in the 1970s and were commonly used for data backup  software distribution  and file transfer. Floppy disks typically consisted of a flexible plastic disk coated with a magnetic material that could store data in the form of magnetized spots on the surface of the disk.  They came in a variety of sizes and formats  including 5. 25-inch and 3. 5-inch disks  and had relatively low storage capacities compared to modern storage devices  ranging from a few hundred kilobytes to a few megabytes.
