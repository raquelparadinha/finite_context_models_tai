842 A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a user's computer by a website they visit. Cookies are commonly used in computer science to help websites remember user preferences  login information  or other details about a user's interaction with the website. When a user visits a website  the website sends a cookie to the user's web browser  which stores the cookie on the user's computer.  The next time the user visits the website  the browser sends the cookie back to the website  allowing the website to recognize the user and retrieve any previously stored information. Cookies can be used for various purposes  such as keeping a user logged in to a website  remembering items in a shopping cart  or tracking user behavior for analytics purposes. While cookies are generally harmless  they can also be used for tracking and advertising purposes  which has led to concerns about user privacy.  Modern web browsers typically provide options for users to manage cookies  including the ability to block or delete cookies from certain websites.
