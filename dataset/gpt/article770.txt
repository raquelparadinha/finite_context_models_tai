769 A file server is a computer or device that is dedicated to storing and managing files that can be accessed by other computers on a network. File servers typically have large storage capacities and are optimized for serving files to multiple users simultaneously.  They can be used to centralize file storage  making it easier for users to share files and collaborate on projects. In a typical file server setup  the server is connected to the network and contains one or more shared folders that users can access from their own computers.  The server may also provide access control features  such as user authentication and file permissions  to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify files. File servers are commonly used in businesses and organizations where multiple users need to access and share files.  They can also be used in home networks to centralize file storage and enable easier file sharing between family members.
