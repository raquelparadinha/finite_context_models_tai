807 A timing attack is a type of security attack that exploits the variability in the time taken by a computer system to perform specific operations in order to extract sensitive information or gain unauthorized access.  The attack is based on the observation of the time differences between operations  which can reveal information about encryption keys  passwords  or other sensitive data.  This information can then be used to compromise the security of the system.  Timing attacks can be carried out both locally  on the attacker's own machine  or remotely  over a network.
