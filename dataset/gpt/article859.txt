858 The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system used to translate human-readable domain names  such as www. example. com  into machine-readable IP addresses  such as 192. 0. 2. 1. DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system that provides a way for computers to locate and connect to other computers and services on the Internet. When a user enters a domain name into a web browser or other network application  the application sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.  The DNS server then checks its own cache or forwards the request to other DNS servers until it finds the IP address associated with the domain name. DNS also provides other important functions  such as domain name registration  delegation  and management  as well as security features like DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) that help prevent DNS attacks and ensure the authenticity of DNS information. DNS is a critical component of the Internet infrastructure and is used by billions of people and devices worldwide every day.
