687 Yahoo Inc.  is an American multinational technology company that was founded in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo.  Initially  Yahoo started as a web directory but later expanded into a wide range of internet services  including email  search  news  finance  sports  and advertising.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s  Yahoo was one of the most popular websites on the internet and played a significant role in shaping the early internet era. However  Yahoo struggled to keep up with the fast-changing landscape of the internet and faced stiff competition from newer players like Google and Facebook.  In 2017  Yahoo was acquired by Verizon Communications and merged with AOL to form a new company called Oath Inc.  Later  Oath was rebranded as Verizon Media. Today  Yahoo is still one of the most visited websites globally  with over 800 million monthly active users.  Its services include Yahoo Mail  Yahoo News  Yahoo Finance  Yahoo Sports  and Yahoo Search  among others.  However  Yahoo's market share has declined significantly in recent years  and it no longer dominates the internet space like it did in the early days of the web.
