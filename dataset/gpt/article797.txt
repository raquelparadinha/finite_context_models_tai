796 Fractals have many computing applications across a wide range of fields  including computer graphics  scientific modeling  image compression  and data analysis.  Some specific computing applications of fractals are:Computer graphics: Fractals are often used to generate complex  natural-looking patterns in computer graphics  such as landscapes  clouds  and trees.  Fractal-based algorithms are used in 3D modeling software  video game engines  and special effects software. Scientific modeling: Fractal geometry is used in many areas of science and engineering to model complex systems and phenomena  such as fluid flow  turbulence  and geological formations.  Fractal-based models are used in weather forecasting  environmental modeling  and material science. Image compression: Fractal image compression is a technique that uses self-similarity in images to achieve high compression ratios without significant loss of image quality.  Fractal-based compression algorithms are used in many image and video compression standards  such as JPEG and MPEG. Data analysis: Fractal analysis is a method used to analyze complex data sets  such as financial data or physiological signals  by identifying patterns of self-similarity.  Fractal-based algorithms are used in many fields  such as economics  biology  and psychology  to analyze complex data sets and extract meaningful information.
