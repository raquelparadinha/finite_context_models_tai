795 In computing  fractals refer to mathematical objects that exhibit self-similar patterns at different scales.  Fractals are generated using complex mathematical equations  and the resulting patterns can be extremely complex and beautiful. Fractals are used in many areas of computing  including computer graphics  image compression  and scientific modeling.  In computer graphics  fractals can be used to create natural-looking landscapes and other complex patterns that would be difficult to generate using traditional methods. One of the most famous fractals is the Mandelbrot set  which is generated by iterating a simple equation over a complex plane.  The resulting image is a complex and intricate pattern that exhibits self-similarity at different scales.  The Mandelbrot set has been used in many areas of science and engineering  including the study of chaos theory  the design of antennas  and the analysis of financial data.
