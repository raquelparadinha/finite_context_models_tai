851 A Digital Certificate  also known as a public key certificate  is an electronic document that is used to verify the authenticity of a digital entity  such as a website  server  or person. Digital certificates work by linking a public key to an identity  such as the name of a website or organization.  The certificate is issued by a trusted third party  called a Certificate Authority (CA)  who verifies the identity of the entity and signs the certificate with their own digital signature.  This creates a chain of trust  in which a user can trust the entity's identity because they trust the CA that issued the certificate. When a user connects to a website or server that has a digital certificate  their browser or application checks the certificate to ensure that it is valid and issued by a trusted CA.  If the certificate is valid  the user's browser or application can establish a secure connection with the entity using encryption to protect the data that is transmitted between them. Digital certificates are commonly used to secure online transactions  such as online shopping and banking  as well as to protect sensitive data and communications.  They play a crucial role in establishing trust and security on the internet  and are an essential component of many security protocols  such as SSL/TLS.
