846 Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an error-detection code used in digital communication networks and storage devices.  It works by generating a code for transmitted data using a mathematical algorithm  and checking the received data against the generated code.  If the two match  the data is assumed to be error-free.  It is widely used for error detection  but it cannot correct errors once they are detected.
