771 File sharing refers to the process of making files available to other users over a network or the internet.  This can be done in a variety of ways  including through a file server  email attachment  cloud storage service  or peer-to-peer (P2P) network. A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of network where computers or devices communicate directly with each other  rather than through a central server.  P2P networks are commonly used for file sharing  as they allow users to share files with others without the need for a central file server.  In a P2P network  each user's computer acts as both a client and a server  enabling files to be shared directly between users. In a P2P file sharing network  users can search for and download files from other users who have made those files available for sharing.  Examples of popular P2P file sharing networks include BitTorrent  eDonkey  and Gnutella.  While P2P networks can facilitate fast and efficient file sharing  they can also pose security risks and be used for illegal activities such as copyright infringement.
