Some examples of string-oriented languages include:Perl: Perl is a high-level  interpreted language that is widely used for web development  system administration  and network programming.  It provides powerful features for working with strings  including regular expressions  string interpolation  and string manipulation functions. Python: Python is a popular interpreted language that is widely used for scientific computing  data analysis  and web development.  It includes a rich set of string manipulation functions  such as string slicing  concatenation  and searching. Ruby: Ruby is a high-level  object-oriented language that is known for its simplicity and flexibility.  It provides powerful string manipulation features  such as regular expressions  string interpolation  and string slicing. JavaScript: JavaScript is a widely used language for web development that provides powerful string manipulation functions  such as string concatenation  substring extraction  and search functions.
