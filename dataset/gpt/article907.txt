906 A secure hash is a cryptographic function that takes an input (such as a message or data file) and produces a fixed-size output  called a hash or message digest.  The hash is designed to be a unique and irreversible representation of the input data  meaning that even a small change in the input will result in a vastly different hash value.  Secure hash functions are commonly used for message integrity checking  digital signatures  and password storage.  Examples of popular secure hash functions include SHA-256 and MD5.
