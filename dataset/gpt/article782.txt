781 FireWire  also known as IEEE 1394  is a high-speed serial bus interface standard used for connecting peripheral devices to computers.  It was developed by Apple in the 1990s and later standardized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). FireWire provides a fast and reliable interface for connecting devices such as hard drives  digital cameras  and audio interfaces to a computer.  It supports data transfer rates of up to 400 Mbps (FireWire 400) or 800 Mbps (FireWire 800)  which is faster than USB 2. 0.
