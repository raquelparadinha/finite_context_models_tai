898 In computer science  a protocol refers to a set of rules and procedures that dictate how data is transmitted over a network.  Protocols ensure that devices and systems can communicate with each other effectively and efficiently  even if they are made by different manufacturers or use different operating systems. A protocol defines the format and structure of data packets  as well as the order and timing of their transmission.  It also specifies how errors and other issues should be handled  and what actions should be taken in the event of a problem. There are many different protocols used in computer networks  ranging from low-level protocols such as Ethernet and TCP/IP to application-level protocols such as HTTP and FTP.  Each protocol has its own specific purpose and functionality  and they work together to create a seamless and reliable communication network.
