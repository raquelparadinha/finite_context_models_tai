713 Internationalization and localization are two related concepts that are important for adapting software and other digital products to different languages  cultures  and regions. Internationalization (often abbreviated as i18n) is the process of designing and developing software so that it can be easily adapted to different languages and regions.  This involves separating the user interface text and other content from the software code  so that it can be translated and localized without modifying the underlying code.  Internationalization also involves addressing other cultural and technical differences  such as date and time formats  numeric conventions  and character sets. Localization (often abbreviated as l10n) is the process of adapting software to a specific language or region  taking into account the cultural and linguistic differences of the target audience.  This involves translating the user interface text  as well as adapting other content and features to meet the needs and expectations of the local audience.  Localization can also involve testing and validating the localized product to ensure that it is fully functional and meets the quality standards of the target market. Together  internationalization and localization enable software and other digital products to be used by people in different countries and regions  and they are essential for reaching a global audience and expanding business opportunities.
