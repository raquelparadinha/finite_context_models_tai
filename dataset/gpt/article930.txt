929 The ergonomics of computing is the study of how to design and arrange computer workstations and other computer-related equipment to optimize human comfort  safety  and efficiency while using computers.  It involves designing computer equipment and workspaces in a way that reduces the risk of injury  strain  or discomfort caused by repetitive movements  poor posture  or other factors. Ergonomics is an important consideration in computing because prolonged use of computers can lead to a range of physical and mental health issues  such as eye strain  back and neck pain  carpal tunnel syndrome  and stress.  By designing computer workstations and equipment with ergonomics in mind  the risk of developing these problems can be significantly reduced.
