967 Distributed computing is a method of computing in which a large number of computers work together to solve a complex problem or perform a task.  The computers in a distributed computing system are connected over a network  and each computer in the network contributes its processing power and resources to the task at hand. Distributed computing is used in a wide range of applications  including scientific research  data analysis  and large-scale simulations.  For example  a distributed computing system may be used to analyze large datasets  search for patterns in complex data  or simulate complex physical systems.
