857 A DDoS attack is a cyber attack in which multiple compromised computers or devices overwhelm a targeted website  server  or network with a large volume of traffic or requests.  The aim is to make the system unavailable or unusable.  DDoS attacks can cause significant damage to an organization's reputation and bottom line.  To protect against DDoS attacks  organizations can use various techniques  but they can be difficult to defend against if carried out using sophisticated techniques or targeted vulnerabilities.
