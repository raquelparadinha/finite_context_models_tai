924 Emulation refers to the process of simulating the behavior of one computer system on another computer system.  The purpose of emulation is to allow software or hardware designed for one system to run on a different system  typically with different hardware or software configurations.  To emulate a system  software known as an emulator must be installed on the host system.  The emulator simulates the behavior of the original hardware or software platform  allowing the system to run software designed for the original platform. Emulation can be resource-intensive  as the host system must dedicate significant processing power and memory resources to simulating the behavior of the emulated system.  As a result  emulation may not always be feasible for more complex systems or applications.  However  for simpler systems and applications  emulation can be a valuable tool for preserving legacy software and hardware  or for testing and development purposes.
