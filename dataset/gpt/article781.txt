780 Firewalls serve several important functions in computer networks  including:Traffic filtering: Firewalls can be configured to block or allow incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.  This allows the firewall to filter out unwanted or malicious traffic  such as viruses  malware  spam  and unauthorized access attempts. Access control: Firewalls can control access to network resources by allowing or denying traffic based on user identity  network location  time of day  or other factors.  This helps to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data or resources. Network address translation (NAT): Firewalls can perform NAT  which allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.  This provides an additional layer of security by hiding the internal IP addresses from the internet. Logging and auditing: Firewalls can log network traffic and generate reports on network activity  including attempted attacks and unauthorized access attempts.  This information can be used for troubleshooting  monitoring  and compliance purposes. Virtual private network (VPN): Some firewalls include VPN functionality  which allows remote users to securely connect to the network over the internet.  This enables remote workers to access network resources from outside the office in a secure manner.
