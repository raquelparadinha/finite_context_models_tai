815 ActiveX is a set of technologies developed by Microsoft that allows software components to be reused across different applications and platforms.  ActiveX is based on the Component Object Model (COM) and allows components to be developed in various programming languages such as C++  Visual Basic  and Java. ActiveX components are designed to be installed on a client's computer and accessed by other applications  such as web browsers or office applications.  They can provide a range of functionality  including user interface controls  data access components  and multimedia playback components. ActiveX components can be downloaded and installed automatically from web servers when a user visits a website that uses them.  This feature is often used by web developers to provide additional functionality to their web pages  such as multimedia playback  interactive forms  and dynamic content. While ActiveX provides many benefits in terms of code reuse and functionality  it has also been criticized for its security vulnerabilities.  ActiveX controls can potentially allow malicious code to be executed on a user's computer if they are not properly secured or validated.  As a result  many web browsers have implemented security measures to prevent unauthorized installation of ActiveX controls.
