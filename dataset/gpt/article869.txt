868 A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of security rules.  It acts as a barrier between a private internal network and the public internet or other untrusted networks  allowing only authorized traffic to pass through while blocking unauthorized or potentially harmful traffic. Firewalls can be implemented as software or hardware devices  and they typically use one or more of the following techniques to filter traffic:Packet filtering: Examines the source and destination addresses and other packet header information to determine whether to allow or block the packet. Stateful inspection: Tracks the state of network connections and allows only legitimate traffic to pass through based on that state. Application-level gateway: Analyzes the content of application-layer protocols such as HTTP or FTP to filter traffic based on application-specific rules. Firewalls are an important component of network security and can help prevent unauthorized access  data breaches  and other types of cyber attacks.
