527 Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows different objects to be treated as if they were the same type.  It allows code to be more flexible and reusable by allowing different objects to be used interchangeably. To illustrate this concept with an example  let's consider a program that deals with different shapes  such as circles  squares  and triangles.  Each shape has its own unique properties and methods  such as its size  color  and the ability to calculate its perimeter. Now  let's suppose we want to create a method that takes a shape object as input and calculates its perimeter.  We can use polymorphism to create a single method that works for all types of shapes  rather than creating separate methods for each shape.
