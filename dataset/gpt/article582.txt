581 RPG  or Report Program Generator  is a high-level programming language originally developed by IBM in the late 1950s for use on their IBM System/3x mid-range computers.  RPG was designed specifically for generating reports and was particularly well-suited for working with the IBM database management system (DB2). Over the years  RPG has evolved and expanded to become a more versatile language  capable of handling more complex programming tasks beyond report generation.  Modern versions of RPG support structured programming constructs  object-oriented programming  and integration with web services. RPG is still widely used today  particularly in IBM i (formerly known as AS/400 or iSeries) environments  which are often used in industries such as finance  manufacturing  and healthcare.  RPG has a loyal following among developers who appreciate its simplicity and ease of use  as well as its integration with IBM i system functions.
