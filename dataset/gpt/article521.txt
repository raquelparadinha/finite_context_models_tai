520 A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a dedicated high-speed network that provides block-level access to data storage.  In a SAN  storage devices such as disk arrays  tape libraries  and other storage appliances are connected to servers through a series of switches and/or hubs. SANs are designed to provide high-speed  reliable access to large amounts of data  and are often used in enterprise environments where large amounts of data need to be stored and accessed by multiple servers and applications.  SANs provide centralized storage management  which allows administrators to allocate storage resources to servers and applications as needed. SANs typically use Fibre Channel or iSCSI protocols to connect storage devices to the network.  Fibre Channel is a high-speed  dedicated network technology that provides very low latency and high reliability.  iSCSI  on the other hand  is an IP-based protocol that allows storage devices to be connected to the network using standard Ethernet connections. SANs can provide a number of benefits  including increased performance  scalability  and availability of data.  They are often used in data centers and other large-scale IT environments to provide high-performance storage for critical applications and data.
