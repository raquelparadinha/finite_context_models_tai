789 A flowchart is a visual representation of a process or algorithm that uses symbols and arrows to illustrate the steps and decision points involved in the process.  Flowcharts are commonly used in software development  engineering  and other fields to help visualize and communicate complex processes or systems. In a flowchart  each step in the process is represented by a symbol or shape  such as a rectangle  diamond  or circle.  Arrows are used to show the flow of the process  indicating the sequence of steps and any decision points or loops in the process. Flowcharts can be used to model a wide range of processes  from simple procedures to complex systems involving multiple components and decision points.  They can help identify inefficiencies or bottlenecks in a process and can be used to develop and test new processes or software systems.
