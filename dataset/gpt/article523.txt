522 Neuroprosthetics is a field of study that involves developing devices that can replace or restore the function of the nervous system.  These devices are designed to interface directly with the brain  spinal cord  or peripheral nerves and can be used to restore movement  sensation  or other functions that may have been lost due to injury or disease. At Duke University  researchers have been working on developing advanced neuroprosthetics that can help people with spinal cord injuries regain movement and mobility.  One of the key areas of focus has been on developing brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that can translate brain activity into movement. In a recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine  researchers at Duke University demonstrated that a monkey with a spinal cord injury was able to regain the ability to walk with the help of a brain-controlled robotic exoskeleton.  The monkey had electrodes implanted in its brain that were able to decode signals related to movement and translate them into commands that controlled the robotic exoskeleton. The researchers also used a wireless connection to send feedback from the exoskeleton back to the monkey's brain  which allowed it to adjust its movements in real-time.  This approach has the potential to enable people with spinal cord injuries to regain movement and independence. Overall  the research carried out at Duke University and other institutions in the field of neuroprosthetics is aimed at developing new and innovative approaches to restoring function and improving the quality of life for people with neurological disorders or injuries.
