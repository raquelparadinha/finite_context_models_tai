649 A template is a pre-designed format or layout that serves as a starting point for creating a new document  project  or website.  It is essentially a pre-built framework that contains placeholders for text  images  and other elements that can be customized to create a finished product. Templates can be found in many different contexts  including word processing software  graphic design tools  and website builders.  For example  a word processing template might include pre-set margins  fonts  and styles for a specific type of document  such as a resume or a letter.  A graphic design template might include a pre-made layout for a business card or a flyer.  A website template might include pre-built pages  menus  and widgets that can be customized to create a complete website. Using templates can save time and effort  as the basic structure and formatting are already in place.  They can also help ensure consistency and professionalism across multiple documents or projects.
