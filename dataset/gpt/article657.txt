656 A binary tree is a type of tree in which each node has at most two child nodes  which are called the left child and right child.  Binary trees are widely used in computer science and data structures to represent hierarchical relationships between data elements. In a binary tree  each node contains a value or key  as well as pointers or references to its left and right child nodes.  The left child node is typically smaller than the parent node  while the right child node is typically larger than the parent node.  This ordering property of binary trees allows for efficient searching and sorting of data. In terms of memory allocation  each node in a binary tree is typically implemented as a struct or a class in programming languages such as C++ or Java.  The struct or class contains fields or members for storing the node's key value  as well as pointers or references to its left and right child nodes. Memory allocation for binary trees is typically done dynamically using heap memory.  When a new node is created  memory is allocated for the node using a memory allocation function such as malloc() in C or new() in C++.  The allocated memory is then used to store the node's key value and pointers or references to its child nodes. When a node is no longer needed  its memory is freed using a memory deallocation function such as free() in C or delete() in C++.  This helps to avoid memory leaks and ensure efficient use of memory.
