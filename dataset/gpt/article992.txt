991 Cellular automata are mathematical models consisting of a grid of cells  each of which can be in one of a finite number of states  and a set of rules that determine how the cells change state over time.  Cellular automata have been used in a wide variety of fields  including:Physics: Cellular automata can be used to model physical systems  such as the behavior of fluids  gases  and solids.  They can also be used to simulate the behavior of subatomic particles and the evolution of the universe. Biology: Cellular automata have been used to model biological systems  such as the spread of diseases  the growth of bacterial colonies  and the behavior of animal populations. Computer Science: Cellular automata have been used in computer science for a variety of applications  including cryptography  image processing  and artificial intelligence. Economics: Cellular automata have been used to model economic systems  such as the behavior of stock markets and the spread of financial crises. Sociology: Cellular automata have been used to model social systems  such as the spread of rumors  the diffusion of innovations  and the emergence of social norms. Art: Cellular automata have been used as a tool for creating art and music  often by using the patterns generated by the rules to create visual or auditory stimuli.
