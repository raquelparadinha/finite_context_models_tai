816 Advisory and Notification Markup Language (ANML) is an XML-based language used for defining notification and alert messages in a machine-readable format.  ANML was developed to standardize the format of notifications and alerts  making it easier for different systems and applications to exchange this information. ANML is designed to be flexible and extensible  allowing users to define their own custom elements and attributes.  It includes a set of predefined elements and attributes for common notification and alert scenarios  such as device failures  network events  and security breaches.  ANML messages can also include instructions for how the recipient system should respond to the notification  such as acknowledging receipt  taking corrective action  or notifying a human operator. ANML is used in a variety of applications  including network management  security monitoring  and industrial control systems.  It is an open standard  which means that anyone can use and implement it without paying licensing fees.
