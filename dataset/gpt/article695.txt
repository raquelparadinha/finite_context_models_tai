694 A loop is a control flow construct that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times.  The idea behind a loop is to automate the repetitive tasks within a program  making it more concise and efficient.  There are several types of loops in computer programming  including:For loop: used to repeat a block of code for a specified number of times. While loop: used to repeat a block of code as long as a specified condition is met. Do-While loop: used to repeat a block of code at least once  and then continue to repeat the block as long as a specified condition is met. Foreach loop: used to iterate over elements in a collection  such as an array or list. Loops are fundamental concepts in computer programming and can be found in most programming languages  including Python  Java  C++  and many others.
