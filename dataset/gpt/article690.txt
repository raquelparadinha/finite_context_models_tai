689 Neurality refers to the concept of neural networks  which are a type of artificial intelligence modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks are composed of interconnected nodes  called artificial neurons  that process and transmit information.  Each neuron receives input from multiple other neurons and computes a weighted sum of these inputs.  The neuron then passes this sum through a nonlinear activation function to produce an output  which is then transmitted to other neurons.  This process of computing weighted sums and passing the results through activation functions is repeated multiple times  allowing the neural network to build increasingly complex representations of the input data. Neural networks can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks  such as image recognition  language translation  and even playing games like chess.  The training process involves adjusting the weights on the connections between neurons so as to minimize a chosen loss function.  This process is repeated for multiple passes over the training data  until the network has learned to accurately predict the desired output for a given input.
