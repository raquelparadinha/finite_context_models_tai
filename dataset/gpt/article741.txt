740 Computer-related businesses are heavily impacted by the effects of globalization  as they operate in a global marketplace that is increasingly interconnected and competitive.  Here are some ways in which computer-related businesses deal with the effects of globalization:Internationalization: Many computer-related businesses seek to expand their operations globally  by entering new markets and developing international partnerships.  This involves adapting their products and services to meet the needs of different cultures and languages  as well as complying with local regulations and laws. Outsourcing: Globalization has led to the outsourcing of many computer-related jobs to countries where labor is cheaper  such as India and China.  This allows businesses to reduce costs and increase efficiency  but it also raises ethical and social concerns about the impact on local workers and economies. Competition: Globalization has led to increased competition in the computer industry  as businesses from different countries compete for customers and market share.  This has led to rapid innovation and development  but it also presents challenges for businesses that must keep up with changing technologies and market trends. Supply chain management: Many computer-related businesses rely on complex global supply chains to manufacture and distribute their products.  This involves managing relationships with suppliers and partners in different countries  as well as ensuring compliance with international trade and environmental regulations.
