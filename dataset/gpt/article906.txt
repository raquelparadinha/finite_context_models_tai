905 A sector in a hard disk is a small section of the disk's magnetic storage surface that is used to store a fixed amount of data.  It is typically the smallest unit of data that can be read from or written to the disk.  Sectors are organized into tracks  which are concentric circles on the disk's surface.  The number of sectors per track and the number of tracks per disk surface determine the storage capacity of the hard disk.  Modern hard disks have sector sizes of 512 bytes or 4 kilobytes  although larger sector sizes are becoming more common.
