525 Floating point numbers are typically stored in memory using a standardized format  such as the IEEE 754 standard.  This format uses a combination of a sign bit  an exponent  and a mantissa to represent the value of the floating point number. The sign bit indicates whether the value is positive or negative.  It is represented using a single bit  with 0 indicating a positive value and 1 indicating a negative value. The exponent represents the power of 2 by which the mantissa should be multiplied.  It is represented using a fixed number of bits  which depends on the specific floating point format being used.  For example  in single-precision floating point format (which uses 32 bits)  the exponent is represented using 8 bits. The mantissa represents the significant digits of the floating point number.  It is also represented using a fixed number of bits  which depends on the specific floating point format being used.  In single-precision floating point format  the mantissa is represented using 23 bits. To store a floating point number in memory  the computer first converts the number to the standardized floating point format  using the appropriate number of bits for the sign  exponent  and mantissa.  The resulting binary representation is then stored in memory at a specific memory address. When a program needs to use the floating point number  it reads the binary representation from memory  converts it back to the original floating point value  and performs the necessary calculations.
