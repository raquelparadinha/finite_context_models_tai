603 Freeware is software that is available for free  without any cost or payment required.  Freeware first came into existence in the 1980s and 1990s  as personal computers became more popular and affordable  and software developers began to create software for these new platforms. One of the earliest examples of freeware was PC-Write  a word processing program created by Bob Wallace in 1983.  Wallace initially sold the program  but later decided to release it as freeware  allowing users to download and use it for free.  Other early examples of freeware included games  utilities  and other software programs that were distributed through bulletin board systems (BBS) and other early computer networks. The growth of the internet in the 1990s further fueled the development and distribution of freeware  as developers were able to reach a much larger audience through online distribution.  The open-source software movement also played a role in the growth of freeware  as developers began to release source code for their software under licenses that allowed others to modify and distribute the software for free. Today  freeware continues to be an important part of the software landscape  with many popular programs and tools available for free download and use.  While some freeware is supported by advertising or other revenue streams  many developers release their software as a labor of love  to contribute to the community and to share their work with others.
