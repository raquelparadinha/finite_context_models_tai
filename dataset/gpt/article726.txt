725 A hard drive is a non-volatile storage device used to store digital data  such as computer files and software applications.  It consists of one or more platters  which are circular disks coated with a magnetic material that can store data  and a set of read/write heads that can read and write data to the platters. When data is written to a hard drive  the read/write heads magnetically encode the data onto the platters.  To read the data  the read/write heads move over the platters and sense the magnetic fields to retrieve the encoded data.  Hard drives typically spin at high speeds  often between 5400 and 7200 revolutions per minute (RPM)  to enable faster data access. Hard drives come in different form factors  such as 2. 5-inch and 3. 5-inch drives  and in different capacities  ranging from a few hundred gigabytes to several terabytes.  They can be connected to a computer via various interfaces  such as SATA  SCSI  or IDE  and can be internal or external. In addition to traditional hard drives  there are also solid-state drives (SSDs) that use flash memory to store data.  Unlike hard drives  SSDs have no moving parts  which makes them faster and more durable than hard drives.  However  they are generally more expensive and have lower storage capacities than hard drives. Hard drives are a common type of storage device used in personal computers  servers  and other computing devices.  They are used to store operating systems  applications  and user data  and are often the primary storage device in a computer system.
