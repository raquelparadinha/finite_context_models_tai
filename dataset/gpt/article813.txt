812 Access Control Matrix (ACM) is a security model used to specify the access rights of subjects to objects in a computer system.  The ACM is a table or matrix that lists all the subjects (users  processes  programs) and objects (files  directories  devices) in a system  along with the access rights that each subject has to each object.  The access rights can include read  write  execute  and delete permissions. In an ACM  each row represents a subject and each column represents an object.  Each cell in the matrix indicates the access rights of the corresponding subject to the corresponding object.  For example  a cell may contain the value rwx to indicate that the subject has read  write  and execute permissions to the object. The ACM provides a way to control and manage access to resources in a system by ensuring that only authorized users or processes can access specific objects.  It is also useful for auditing and tracking user activity  as it provides a clear view of who has access to what resources in the system. ACMs can be implemented using various access control models  such as discretionary access control (DAC)  mandatory access control (MAC)  and role-based access control (RBAC).  Each of these models uses different methods for assigning access rights to subjects based on their identity  job function  or security clearance level.
