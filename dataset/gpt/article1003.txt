1002 In computing  the term last mile refers to the final leg of the telecommunications network that connects the end user to the wider network.  The last mile typically refers to the physical connection between a user's premises (such as a home or office) and the telecommunications provider's network infrastructure. The last mile is often considered the most challenging and expensive part of the telecommunications network to build and maintain  as it involves deploying physical infrastructure (such as cables or wireless towers) to reach individual homes and businesses.  In many cases  the cost of deploying and maintaining this infrastructure can be prohibitively high  particularly in rural or remote areas. The quality and reliability of the last mile connection can have a significant impact on the performance and usability of internet and telecommunications services.  For example  if the last mile connection is slow or unreliable  users may experience slow internet speeds  dropped calls  or other issues that impact their ability to access and use digital services. There are several technologies used to provide last mile connectivity  including wired technologies such as DSL  cable modems  and fiber optic cables  as well as wireless technologies such as cellular networks  satellite internet  and fixed wireless connections.
