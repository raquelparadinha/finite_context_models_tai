920 A touch screen is a type of display that allows users to interact with a computer or electronic device by touching the screen directly with their fingers or a stylus.  Touch screens can be found on a wide range of devices  including smartphones  tablets  computers  and kiosks. There are several types of touch screens  each with its own technology and method for detecting touch inputs:Resistive Touch Screens: These screens consist of two layers of flexible material  with a conductive coating on each layer.  When the screen is pressed  the layers come into contact and the touch point is detected by measuring changes in electrical resistance. Capacitive Touch Screens: These screens use a conductive layer that stores electrical charges.  When a finger or stylus touches the screen  it changes the electrical field and the touch point is detected by measuring these changes. Infrared Touch Screens: These screens use infrared sensors to detect touch inputs.  When the screen is touched  the infrared light is interrupted and the touch point is detected based on the location of the interruption. Surface Acoustic Wave Touch Screens: These screens use ultrasonic waves to detect touch inputs.  When the screen is touched  the waves are disrupted and the touch point is detected based on the location of the disruption.
