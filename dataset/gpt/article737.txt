736 Geographic data is typically stored in a geographic information system (GIS) database or file format.  A GIS is a software system designed to store  manipulate  and analyze spatial data  which includes both geographic and cartographic data. There are several common data storage formats used in GIS:Shapefile: A shapefile is a common format for storing vector data  such as points  lines  and polygons.  It consists of several files that store the spatial and attribute data. GeoJSON: GeoJSON is a format for encoding geographic data structures in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).  It is a lightweight format that is commonly used for web mapping applications. Geodatabase: A geodatabase is a proprietary format used by Esri's ArcGIS software.  It can store both vector and raster data  and provides advanced features for data management  editing  and analysis. KML: Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is a file format used for displaying geographic data in Google Earth and other virtual globes.  It can store points  lines  polygons  and other features. GeoTIFF: GeoTIFF is a format for storing raster data with geographic information.  It includes georeferencing information  such as the location  scale  and orientation of the raster image.
