953 Structured data types are data types that are made up of multiple elements or components  each with its own data type.  These elements can be combined to form more complex data structures that represent real-world objects or concepts. Some examples of structured data types include:Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type  accessed using an index or a pointer. Structures: A collection of elements of different data types  grouped together under a single name. Classes: Similar to structures  but with additional features like inheritance and encapsulation. Records: A collection of elements of different data types  used to represent a single entity or concept. Enumerations: A set of named constants  used to represent a discrete set of values. Pointers: A variable that holds the memory address of another variable or data structure. Structured data types provide a way to organize and manipulate complex data in a more manageable way.  By grouping related data elements together  structured data types make it easier to represent real-world objects and concepts in software programs.  They also provide a way to pass multiple values between functions or modules in a program  making it easier to write modular and reusable code.
