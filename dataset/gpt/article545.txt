544 Levels of precedence in programming languages determine the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.  The following are the typical levels of precedence followed by most programming languages  in order from highest to lowest:Parentheses: Any expressions contained within parentheses are evaluated first. Unary Operators: Unary operators  such as negation (-) and logical NOT (!)  are evaluated next. Exponentiation: Exponentiation operators  such as the caret (^) in some languages  are evaluated next. Multiplication and Division: Multiplication (*) and division (/) operators are evaluated next  in left-to-right order. Addition and Subtraction: Addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators are evaluated next  in left-to-right order. Relational Operators: Relational operators  such as less than (<) and greater than (>)  are evaluated next. Equality Operators: Equality operators  such as equals (==) and not equals (!=)  are evaluated next. Logical AND: The logical AND operator (&&) is evaluated next. Logical OR: The logical OR operator (||) is evaluated last. It's important to note that some programming languages may have different levels of precedence or slightly different rules for evaluating expressions.  Therefore  it's essential to consult the documentation of a particular programming language to determine its specific order of precedence for operators.
