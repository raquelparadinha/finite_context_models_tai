747 GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a file format used to store and display simple animated images or graphics on web pages or in other digital media.  It was developed by CompuServe in the late 1980s. A GIF file consists of a sequence of images or frames that are displayed in rapid succession  creating the illusion of motion.  GIFs are limited to 256 colors  which makes them relatively small in size and easy to share online.
