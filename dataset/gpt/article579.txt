578 Industrial robotics refers to the use of robots in industrial manufacturing processes.  The development of industrial robotics can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s  when the first programmable robots were created. The first industrial robot  the Unimate  was created in 1954 by George Devol and Joseph Engelberger.  It was used to automate the production line at a General Motors plant in New Jersey.  The Unimate was a large  hydraulic robot that could lift heavy objects and move them along a set path.  It was controlled by a computer program that could be programmed to repeat a set of motions. In the following years  the use of industrial robots became more widespread  particularly in the automotive industry.  Robots were used to perform tasks such as welding  painting  and assembly on production lines.  This led to increased efficiency and productivity in manufacturing processes  as well as improved worker safety. As technology advanced  industrial robots became more advanced and capable.  They became smaller and more precise  and were able to perform a wider range of tasks.  Today  industrial robots are used in a variety of industries  including electronics  pharmaceuticals  and food production.  They continue to play an important role in increasing efficiency  productivity  and safety in manufacturing processes.
