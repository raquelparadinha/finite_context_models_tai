856 A Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) is a documented and structured approach that organizations use to prepare for  respond to  and recover from disasters or disruptions that may affect their critical business operations. A DRP typically involves a series of procedures  policies  and strategies that outline how an organization will continue its operations and recover its systems  data  and infrastructure in the event of a disaster or disruption. The goal of a DRP is to minimize the impact of a disaster or disruption on an organization's operations  reputation  and bottom line by ensuring the availability and recoverability of critical systems and data. DRP procedures may include steps for backing up and restoring data  relocating personnel  activating alternative communication methods  and restoring critical applications and systems. An effective DRP should be regularly reviewed  tested  and updated to ensure that it remains relevant and effective in the face of changing threats  technologies  and business needs.
