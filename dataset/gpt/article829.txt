828 The Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) is an error screen displayed on a Windows computer when the operating system encounters a critical error that it cannot recover from.  The screen appears as a blue background with white text and is also known as a stop error or a system crash. The BSOD is typically caused by hardware or software issues  such as faulty drivers  system files  or memory problems.  When a critical error occurs  Windows displays the BSOD to prevent further damage to the system and to allow the user to troubleshoot the problem. The BSOD screen provides a message that includes a stop code  which can help identify the cause of the error.  The stop code is a hexadecimal code that indicates the type of error that occurred  such as a driver issue or a memory problem. When a BSOD occurs  the computer will typically restart automatically  although it may also display a memory dump or other diagnostic information.  To resolve the issue  users can try to identify the cause of the error using the stop code and other diagnostic information provided on the BSOD screen. BSODs can be frustrating and disruptive  but they are an important safety feature of the Windows operating system that helps prevent further damage to the system when critical errors occur.
