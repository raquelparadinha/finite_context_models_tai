903 A network router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.  It operates at the network layer of the OSI model and uses routing tables to determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination. Routers are commonly used in homes  businesses  and service provider networks to connect multiple networks and facilitate communication between devices.  They can be wired or wireless and may have a variety of features  including built-in firewalls  virtual private network (VPN) support  and Quality of Service (QoS) settings to prioritize traffic. In a typical home or small business network  the router is often the central point of connectivity  connecting devices to the Internet or other networks.  It can be configured to assign IP addresses to devices on the network  manage network traffic  and provide basic security features. Large service provider networks may use more complex routers with advanced routing protocols  such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)  to manage traffic and connect to other networks.
