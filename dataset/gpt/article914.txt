913 Steganography is the practice of concealing a message or data within another file  image  or message to avoid detection.  The hidden message is usually encrypted before being concealed  and can only be accessed by someone who knows how to extract it.  This technique is often used to covertly transmit sensitive or secret information without being detected.  Steganography is different from cryptography  which focuses on making a message unreadable by scrambling its content.
