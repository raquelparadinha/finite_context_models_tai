954 A data warehouse is a large and centralized repository of data that is designed to support business intelligence (BI) activities such as reporting  analytics  and data mining.  It is a system that collects  integrates  organizes  and stores data from a wide variety of sources  including transactional databases  external systems  and data streams. The data in a data warehouse is typically organized around a specific subject or theme  such as sales  marketing  or customer service.  It is also typically structured in a way that is optimized for querying and analysis  with data organized into tables  columns  and rows. Data warehouses are designed to support complex queries and analytics that can uncover insights and patterns that might not be visible in individual transactional databases.  They also often provide tools for data transformation  cleansing  and enrichment to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent. Overall  the goal of a data warehouse is to provide a single  unified view of an organization's data that can be used for strategic decision-making and analysis.
