990 DVD-ROM is a type of optical disc that is used to store digital data.  The acronym DVD stands for Digital Versatile Disc or Digital Video Disc.  The ROM in DVD-ROM stands for Read-Only Memory  which means that the data on the disc can only be read and not written or erased. A DVD-ROM can store up to 4. 7 gigabytes (GB) of data on a single-sided  single-layer disc  and up to 8. 5 GB on a single-sided  dual-layer disc.  This makes it an excellent medium for storing large amounts of data  including movies  music  software  and other digital files. DVD-ROMs are commonly used for distributing commercial movies  software applications  and games.  They can be played on DVD-ROM drives  which are available in most computers and DVD players. The data on a DVD-ROM is stored in a series of pits and lands on the surface of the disc.  A laser in the DVD-ROM drive reads the pits and lands as the disc spins  translating them into digital data that can be used by the computer or other device.
