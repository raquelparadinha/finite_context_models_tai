690 NLP  or Natural Language Processing  is a field of study and technology concerned with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language.  It involves using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and understand human language and to generate text or speech in response. For example  consider a simple NLP application: sentiment analysis.  Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text  such as a movie review.  A sentiment analysis model might take in a movie review written in English and output a label indicating whether the review is positive  negative  or neutral.  The model might make this determination by analyzing the words used in the review and their relationships to each other  as well as other information such as the context in which the words are used.
