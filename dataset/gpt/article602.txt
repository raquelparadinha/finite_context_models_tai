601 A serial port is a type of communication interface on a computer or other device that enables data to be transmitted one bit at a time  sequentially over a single communication channel.  It is a physical connector on a computer that enables communication between the computer and external devices  such as printers  scanners  modems  and other peripherals. Serial ports were commonly used in older computer systems  but have largely been replaced by USB (Universal Serial Bus) and other more advanced interfaces.  Serial ports can still be found in some specialized applications where low-speed data communication is required  such as industrial automation  networking  and scientific instruments. Serial ports are typically labeled as COM ports in Windows systems  and have a standardized set of settings  such as baud rate  data bits  parity  and stop bits  that must be configured to ensure proper communication between devices.
