961 A device driver is a software program that allows the operating system to communicate with and control a specific hardware device such as a printer  scanner  or graphics card.  Device drivers act as a bridge between the hardware device and the operating system  enabling the device to perform its intended functions. When a device is first installed or connected to a computer  the operating system checks to see if a compatible driver is already installed.  If it is not  the operating system will prompt the user to install the necessary driver software.  Once installed  the device driver allows the operating system to interact with the device  sending and receiving data and commands as needed. Device drivers are specific to the hardware they control and are often updated to fix bugs or add new features.  It is important to keep device drivers up-to-date to ensure optimal performance and compatibility with other software and hardware components.
