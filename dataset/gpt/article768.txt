767 A file system is a method used by operating systems to organize  store  and retrieve files on a computer or other digital storage medium  such as a hard drive or flash drive.  It provides a way for users and software programs to access and manage files  and it defines the structure and layout of the storage medium. A file system typically consists of two main components: the file structure and the file management system.  The file structure defines how files are organized and stored on the storage medium  including the directory structure and the file allocation table.  The file management system provides tools and utilities for creating  modifying  and deleting files  as well as for searching for and accessing files.
