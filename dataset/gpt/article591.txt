590 A scanner is a device that captures images or text and converts them into digital data that can be stored  manipulated  and transmitted.  The first scanners were developed in the 1950s and 1960s for specialized applications such as document archiving and scientific research. In the 1980s  scanners became more widely available as personal computers became more popular.  The earliest scanners were flatbed scanners that used a moving light source and a photosensitive element to scan documents or images.  Over time  scanners became more sophisticated  with faster scanning speeds  higher resolutions  and more advanced features such as automatic document feeders  optical character recognition (OCR)  and duplex scanning. Today  scanners are used in a variety of applications  from document archiving and digitization to graphic design  medical imaging  and security screening.  There are many different types of scanners available  including flatbed scanners  sheet-fed scanners  handheld scanners  and drum scanners  each with their own strengths and limitations. Overall  scanners have revolutionized the way we store and transmit information  making it easier and faster to share and access information in digital form.
