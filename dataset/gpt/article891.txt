890 Parallel processing is a type of computing in which multiple processors or cores work together to execute a task simultaneously  allowing for faster processing and greater efficiency.  It's commonly used in scientific simulations  data analytics  and multimedia processing.  There are two main types: shared memory and distributed memory.  Parallel processing is becoming increasingly important in the age of big data and complex computational tasks.
