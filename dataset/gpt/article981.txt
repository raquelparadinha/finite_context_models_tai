980 Network cache is a mechanism used to improve network performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the user or application  rather than retrieving it repeatedly from a remote server. Network cache can operate at different levels  such as in web browsers  content delivery networks (CDNs)  and proxy servers.  For example  web browsers use a cache to store web pages  images  and other resources that are frequently accessed by the user  so that they can be retrieved quickly without having to download them from the internet again.  CDNs use a network of servers located in different regions to cache content  so that users can access it from a server that is geographically closer to them  reducing the latency and improving the performance. Proxy servers also use cache to store frequently accessed content locally  reducing the load on the upstream server and improving the response time for subsequent requests.  This is particularly useful in corporate networks where multiple users access the same content  such as internal web pages  and email attachments.
