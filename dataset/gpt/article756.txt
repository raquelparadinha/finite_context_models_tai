755 Computers are involved in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions throughout their entire lifecycle  from manufacturing to disposal.  Here are some ways that computers contribute to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions:Manufacturing: The production of computers and electronic devices involves the extraction of raw materials  such as metals and minerals  which can contribute to deforestation  soil degradation  and water pollution.  The manufacturing process also requires energy and generates greenhouse gas emissions  particularly through the use of fossil fuels. Energy consumption: The operation of computers requires electricity  which is often generated from fossil fuels such as coal  oil  and natural gas.  The use of energy-intensive data centers  servers  and cooling systems also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. E-waste: The disposal of electronic waste  including computers  can contribute to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  Electronic devices can contain hazardous materials  such as lead  mercury  and cadmium  which can pose health and environmental risks if not disposed of properly.  The disposal of e-waste in landfills or incineration can also release greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide. Upgrades and replacements: The frequent upgrading and replacement of computers and electronic devices can contribute to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  The production and disposal of new devices require energy and resources  while the disposal of old devices generates e-waste.
