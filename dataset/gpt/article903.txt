902 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of access control used to restrict access to computer resources based on a user's role or position within an organization.  With RBAC  access is granted based on predefined roles that are associated with certain privileges and permissions. RBAC allows administrators to manage access control at a higher level of abstraction  simplifying the process of granting and revoking access.  In an RBAC system  users are assigned roles based on their job function  and these roles are associated with specific permissions and access levels. For example  a hospital might use RBAC to control access to patient records.  Doctors and nurses would be assigned roles that allow them to access patient records relevant to their job function  while administrative staff would have a different set of roles and access privileges. RBAC provides several benefits  including increased security  simplified administration  and better compliance with regulatory requirements.  It is commonly used in enterprise-level systems and is supported by many modern operating systems  databases  and network devices.
