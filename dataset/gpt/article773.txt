772 BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing protocol that enables users to share large files over the internet.  The protocol was developed by Bram Cohen in 2001 and has since become one of the most popular P2P file sharing methods on the internet. BitTorrent works by breaking large files into smaller pieces and distributing those pieces across multiple computers on the network.  Users can download and upload different pieces of the file simultaneously  allowing for faster download speeds and more efficient use of network resources. BitTorrent has been used to share a wide variety of files  including movies  music  software  and games.  While the protocol itself is not illegal  it has been associated with copyright infringement and piracy  as users can easily share copyrighted content without permission.  As a result  many countries have taken steps to block or restrict access to BitTorrent and other P2P file sharing networks.
