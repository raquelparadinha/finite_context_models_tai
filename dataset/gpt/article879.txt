878 Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a set of communication standards used for transmitting digital signals over telephone lines.  It enables the transmission of voice  video  and data over the same digital network  and provides faster and more reliable connections than traditional analog phone lines. ISDN supports two types of channels: B channels and D channels.  B channels carry voice  data  and video signals  while D channels carry signaling information and control messages.  ISDN also supports various data transfer rates  ranging from 64 kbps to 2 Mbps  and can be used for various applications  such as video conferencing  faxing  and internet access. However  ISDN has largely been replaced by newer technologies  such as digital subscriber line (DSL) and fiber optic internet  which provide faster and more efficient data transmission over telephone lines.
