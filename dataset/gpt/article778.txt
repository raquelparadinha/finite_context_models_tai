777 A finite state machine (FSM)  also known as a finite automaton  is a mathematical model used to represent a system that can be in one of a finite number of states  and can transition between those states in response to input.  FSMs are used in a variety of applications  including software engineering  circuit design  natural language processing  and many more. An FSM is typically defined by a set of states  a set of inputs  a set of transitions between states  and a set of output actions or behaviors.  The transitions between states are often represented as a directed graph  where each state is a node and each transition is an edge.  The FSM starts in an initial state and transitions between states based on the input it receives.  The output actions or behaviors can be triggered by either the input or the state transition.
