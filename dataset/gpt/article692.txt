691 Multitasking refers to the ability of an individual or a system to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.  In a computing context  multitasking refers to the ability of an operating system to run multiple programs or processes at the same time  allowing the user to switch between them or have multiple programs running in the background. For humans  multitasking can refer to the ability to perform multiple tasks or activities at the same time  such as typing an email while listening to music  or cooking dinner while talking on the phone.  However  research has shown that human multitasking is often not as effective as performing each task separately and in sequence  as multitasking can lead to decreased productivity and increased stress. In both human and computer systems  multitasking can also refer to the ability to quickly switch between tasks and effectively allocate resources to different tasks as needed.  This requires effective management of resources  such as memory and processing power  as well as efficient algorithms for scheduling and switching between tasks.
