779 In the context of computer networking  a firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of predefined security rules.  It acts as a barrier between an internal network and the internet  or between different segments of an internal network  allowing only authorized traffic to pass through and blocking unauthorized or potentially malicious traffic. Firewalls can be implemented as software or hardware  and can be configured to operate at various levels of the network stack  such as the application layer  transport layer  or network layer.  They use a variety of techniques to identify and block unwanted traffic  such as packet filtering  stateful inspection  and deep packet inspection.
