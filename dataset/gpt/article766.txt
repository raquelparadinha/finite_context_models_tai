765 Optical fiber technology offers several advantages over traditional copper-based communication systems  including:High bandwidth: Optical fibers can transmit large amounts of data over long distances at high speeds  making them ideal for high-bandwidth applications such as video streaming  cloud computing  and online gaming. Low attenuation: Optical fibers have low attenuation  which means that they can transmit signals over long distances without significant signal loss or degradation. Immunity to electromagnetic interference: Optical fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference  making them more reliable in high-noise environments. Small size and lightweight: Optical fibers are small and lightweight  making them easy to install and transport. Security: Optical fibers are difficult to tap or intercept  making them more secure than traditional copper-based communication systems. Durability: Optical fibers are highly durable and resistant to damage from moisture  temperature fluctuations  and other environmental factors. Cost-effective: Optical fibers are becoming increasingly cost-effective as the technology becomes more widely adopted and production costs decrease.
