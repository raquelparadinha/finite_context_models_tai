1016 The compilation process is the process by which a compiler translates source code written in a programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer.  The process typically involves several stages:Lexical Analysis: The compiler reads the source code and identifies the tokens (keywords  identifiers  operators  etc. ) in the code. Syntax Analysis: The compiler analyzes the structure of the code to ensure that it conforms to the syntax rules of the programming language.  This stage involves creating an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the code. Semantic Analysis: The compiler performs checks to ensure that the code is semantically correct  such as checking that variables are declared before they are used  and that functions are called with the correct number and type of arguments. Code Generation: The compiler generates machine code that can be executed by the computer.  This involves translating the AST into a lower-level representation of the code  such as assembly language or machine code. Optimization: The compiler may perform various optimizations on the generated code to improve its performance or reduce its size.  This may involve removing redundant code  reordering instructions  or replacing code with more efficient alternatives. Once the compilation process is complete  the resulting machine code can be executed by the computer's processor.  The process of compilation is typically performed by a dedicated software program called a compiler  which is specific to the programming language being used.
