602 The standard for serial transmission is a set of rules and guidelines that specify how data is transmitted over a serial communication channel.  These standards define the physical and electrical characteristics of the communication channel  as well as the format and timing of the data that is transmitted. The most common serial transmission standard is RS-232  which is a standard developed by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) for serial communication between devices.  RS-232 defines the electrical signal levels  timing  and data format for serial communication  including the use of start and stop bits  parity bits  and other control characters. Other serial transmission standards include RS-422  RS-485  and Universal Serial Bus (USB)  each with its own set of specifications for electrical characteristics  signaling  and data format.  These standards are used in different applications and industries  depending on the specific requirements for data transmission. In general  serial transmission involves transmitting data one bit at a time over a single communication channel  with each bit representing a binary value of 0 or 1.  The data is transmitted in a specific format  with each transmission including a start bit  data bits  optional parity bit  and stop bit  which enables the receiving device to synchronize and correctly interpret the data being transmitted.  The speed of transmission is measured in baud rate  which represents the number of signal changes per second.
