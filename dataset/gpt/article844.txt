843 Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) refers to a set of measures and strategies designed to safeguard the security and resilience of critical infrastructure systems  such as power grids  water supplies  transportation systems  and communication networks. CIP involves identifying and assessing the risks to critical infrastructure systems  developing and implementing security policies and procedures  and deploying various technical solutions to detect and prevent cyber threats and physical attacks. CIP is important for ensuring the continuity of essential services and protecting public safety and national security. In many countries  CIP is regulated by government agencies or industry standards  and organizations that operate critical infrastructure systems are required to implement specific security measures and report any incidents or vulnerabilities to relevant authorities.
