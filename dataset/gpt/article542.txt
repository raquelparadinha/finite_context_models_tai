541 Open source software refers to computer software that is distributed with its source code publicly available to anyone to view  modify  and redistribute.  The term open source refers to the fact that the source code is open to the public  rather than being proprietary or closed. Open source software is typically developed collaboratively by a community of developers who contribute code and make improvements to the software over time.  This development process can result in software that is more reliable  secure  and flexible than proprietary software. Open source software can be used for a wide range of applications  from operating systems and programming languages to web servers and databases.  Some examples of popular open source software include the Linux operating system  the Apache web server  the MySQL database  and the Mozilla Firefox web browser. Open source software is often free to use  although there may be costs associated with support  customization  or maintenance.  Additionally  many open source software projects are supported by companies or organizations that offer commercial versions of the software with additional features or support.
