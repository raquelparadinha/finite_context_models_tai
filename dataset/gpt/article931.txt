930 Error correction is the process of detecting and correcting errors that occur during the transmission or storage of data.  In computing  errors can occur due to a variety of factors such as data corruption  interference  or noise in the communication channel  or hardware malfunctions. Error correction codes are used to detect and correct errors in data.  These codes are added to the data before transmission or storage  and they are designed to allow the receiver to detect and correct any errors that may occur during the process. One common error correction code is the Hamming code  which is a binary code that adds extra bits to the data being transmitted.  These extra bits are calculated based on the original data and are used to detect and correct errors in the transmitted data.  Another commonly used error correction code is the Reed-Solomon code  which is used to correct errors in block codes  such as those used in CDs and DVDs. Error correction is important in computing because it ensures the accuracy and reliability of data transmission and storage.  Without error correction  data could be lost or corrupted during transmission  resulting in errors or incorrect information being received.  Error correction helps to ensure that data is transmitted and stored accurately  which is critical for many applications  such as data transfer  online transactions  and digital communication.
