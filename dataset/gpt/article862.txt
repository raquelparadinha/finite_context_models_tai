861 eMail (short for electronic mail) is a digital communication method that allows users to send and receive messages and files over the Internet or other computer networks. eMail works by using a mail client or web-based email service to create  send  receive  and manage messages.  An email message typically includes a subject line  recipient's email address  sender's email address  message body  and optional file attachments. eMail is widely used for personal and professional communication  including business correspondence  marketing campaigns  customer support  and more.  It is a fast and convenient way to exchange information and collaborate with others  regardless of location. However  eMail also poses security risks related to phishing  spam  malware  and other cyber threats.  To mitigate these risks  users can take measures such as using strong passwords  enabling two-factor authentication  and avoiding opening suspicious emails or attachments.
