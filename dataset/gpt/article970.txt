969 The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses  which are the numerical addresses that computers use to identify each other on the internet.  DNS allows users to access websites and other resources using easy-to-remember domain names  rather than having to remember the numerical IP addresses. When a user enters a domain name into a web browser  the browser sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.  The DNS server then looks up the IP address associated with the domain name and returns it to the browser  which can then connect to the appropriate server to access the website or other resource. DNS is hierarchical and distributed  with a global network of DNS servers that work together to resolve domain names.  At the top of the hierarchy are the root servers  which store information about the top-level domain names (such as . com  . org  and . net).  Below the root servers are the authoritative DNS servers  which store information about individual domain names and their associated IP addresses.
