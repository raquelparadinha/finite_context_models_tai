852 Digital Rights Management (DRM) refers to a set of technologies and techniques used to control access to and usage of digital content  such as music  movies  and ebooks. DRM is used to protect the intellectual property rights of content creators and distributors by preventing unauthorized copying  sharing  and distribution of digital content.  It typically involves encryption and digital watermarking techniques that are applied to the content to prevent it from being copied or used without permission. DRM can take different forms  such as password protection  digital certificates  and software that controls access to the content.  Some DRM technologies require users to be connected to the internet in order to access the content  and may limit the number of times that the content can be accessed or shared. While DRM can help protect the intellectual property rights of content creators and distributors  it has been criticized for limiting the rights of users to access and use digital content that they have purchased.  Critics argue that DRM can be overly restrictive and can interfere with legitimate uses of content  such as fair use or personal backups.  In some cases  DRM can also be circumvented by determined users  which raises questions about its effectiveness as a means of protecting digital content.
