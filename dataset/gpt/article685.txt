684 Konrad Zuse (1910-1995) was a German engineer and computer pioneer who is credited with building the world's first programmable digital computer.  Zuse's computer  called the Z3  was completed in 1941 and used binary arithmetic and Boolean logic to perform calculations.  It was also the first computer to use punched tape as a means of input and output. Zuse continued to build and develop computers throughout his career  including the Z1  Z2  and Z4 machines.  He also invented the first high-level programming language  called PlankalkÃ¼l  although it was not widely used during his lifetime. Zuse's work on computers and programming languages was groundbreaking and laid the foundation for the development of modern computing.  He received many awards and honors for his contributions to the field  including the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1964  which is considered one of the most prestigious engineering awards in Germany.
