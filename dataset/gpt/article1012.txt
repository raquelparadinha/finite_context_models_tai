1011 RGB stands for Red  Green  and Blue  which are the primary colors of light.  In the RGB color model  colors are created by combining different intensities of red  green  and blue light.  The model is based on the additive color theory  which states that by adding different intensities of light together  all colors can be created. In the RGB color model  each color component is typically represented as an integer value ranging from 0 to 255  where 0 indicates no intensity and 255 indicates maximum intensity.  By combining different values of red  green  and blue  a total of 16. 7 million colors can be created.
