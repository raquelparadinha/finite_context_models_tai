966 Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a technology that is used to protect and manage digital content  such as music  videos  e-books  and software.  DRM is designed to prevent unauthorized access  copying  distribution  and modification of digital content. DRM typically involves the use of encryption and other technologies to control access to digital content and enforce usage restrictions.  For example  DRM may limit the number of devices that a user can access content on  restrict the amount of time content can be accessed  or prevent users from sharing or copying the content. DRM can be implemented in a variety of ways  depending on the type of digital content and the business model of the content provider.  For example  some music and video streaming services use DRM to prevent users from downloading and sharing content  while e-book providers may use DRM to restrict access to their content to specific devices or apps. While DRM can be effective in protecting digital content and ensuring that content creators and distributors are fairly compensated for their work  it has also been criticized for limiting user rights and freedoms.  Some critics argue that DRM can be overly restrictive and may interfere with users' ability to access and use digital content in legitimate ways.
