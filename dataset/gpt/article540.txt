539 An ontology is a formal  explicit description of concepts and their relationships within a particular domain or area of knowledge.  It defines the types  properties  and interrelationships of the entities that exist in that domain  as well as the rules governing their behavior and interactions. In other words  an ontology is a structured way of representing knowledge and information  and it can be used to support a wide range of applications and systems  such as data integration  knowledge management  semantic search  and artificial intelligence. Ontologies can be developed using various formalisms and languages  such as RDF  OWL  and UML  and they can be designed for different purposes and domains  such as biology  medicine  finance  and engineering.
