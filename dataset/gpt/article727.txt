726 Haptic interfaces  also known as haptic devices or force feedback devices  are computer input/output devices that provide tactile feedback to the user.  They allow the user to interact with digital content by providing physical sensations  such as vibrations  forces  or movements  that simulate real-world experiences. Haptic interfaces are designed to enhance the user's sense of touch and provide a more immersive and realistic experience.  They are often used in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications  where they can be used to simulate the feel of objects or environments in the virtual world.
