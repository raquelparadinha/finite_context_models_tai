728 The history of hacking dates back to the 1960s when the first computer networks were being developed.  However  at that time  hacking was not seen as a criminal activity  and many of the earliest hackers were simply curious students and researchers who wanted to explore the capabilities of the new technology. As computer networks became more widespread in the 1970s and 1980s  hackers began to gain more notoriety  and their activities became more sophisticated.  Some hackers began to engage in illegal activities such as stealing data and disrupting computer systems.  These early hackers were often motivated by a desire for fame  challenge  or financial gain. As the internet became more widespread in the 1990s  the number of hackers and their activities increased dramatically.  Hackers began to form groups and communities  sharing knowledge and tools to help them carry out their activities.  At the same time  law enforcement agencies began to take notice of hacking and to develop strategies to combat it.
