982 Computing has had a significant impact on the design  manufacturing  and operation of cars  leading to the development of various computer-based systems and technologies in the automotive industry.  Some examples of how computing is used in cars are:Engine Management Systems: Modern cars have sophisticated engine management systems that use computer algorithms to control the fuel injection  ignition timing  and other aspects of engine operation.  These systems use sensors to monitor various parameters like engine temperature  air/fuel ratio  and throttle position  and adjust the engine parameters accordingly to optimize performance  fuel efficiency  and emissions. Infotainment Systems: Cars today are equipped with advanced infotainment systems that provide entertainment  navigation  and communication functions.  These systems use touchscreens  voice commands  and other input devices to allow drivers and passengers to control music  phone calls  messaging  and other functions while driving. Autonomous Driving: The development of self-driving cars is one of the most exciting areas of research in the automotive industry.  Self-driving cars use a variety of sensors  including cameras  radar  and lidar  to detect and analyze their surroundings and make decisions about how to navigate.  These systems use complex computer algorithms to control the vehicle's speed  steering  and braking  allowing it to operate autonomously. Safety Systems: Many modern cars come equipped with advanced safety systems that use computing technology to detect and prevent accidents.  For example  anti-lock braking systems (ABS) use sensors and computer algorithms to prevent skidding and maintain control of the vehicle during emergency braking  while electronic stability control (ESC) systems use sensors and actuators to prevent the vehicle from sliding or spinning out of control.
