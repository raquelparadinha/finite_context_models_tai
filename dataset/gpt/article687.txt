686 YouTube  like all major social media platforms  can be influenced by political actors in a variety of ways.  Here are a few examples of how politics can affect YouTube:Content moderation policies: YouTube's policies on what content is allowed on the platform and how that content is moderated can be influenced by political pressure.  For example  governments may pressure YouTube to remove certain videos or channels that they view as being harmful or threatening to national security. Advertising policies: Political campaigns can use YouTube's advertising platform to target voters with their messages.  YouTube has faced criticism in the past for allowing misleading or deceptive political ads to run on the platform. Algorithmic recommendations: YouTube's recommendation algorithm can influence what videos users see on the platform  which in turn can affect their political views.  Political groups may try to manipulate the algorithm to promote their own videos or suppress those of their opponents. Censorship: In some countries  YouTube is blocked or heavily censored by the government.  This can limit access to information and perspectives that are critical of the ruling party or government.
