710 Telnet is a network protocol used to establish a remote login session on a computer or other device over a network. Telnet allows a user to log in to a remote computer or device and perform tasks as if they were sitting in front of it.  This is done by establishing a Telnet session between the user's computer and the remote device  and then sending commands and receiving responses through the Telnet protocol. While Telnet was widely used in the early days of computer networking  it is now considered an insecure protocol  as it sends data and credentials in plain text  which can be intercepted and read by attackers.  For this reason  more secure protocols such as SSH (Secure Shell) are often used instead of Telnet for remote login sessions.
