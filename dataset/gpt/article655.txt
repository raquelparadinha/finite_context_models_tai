654 Transaction processing refers to the process of managing  executing and recording transactions in a computer system or database.  A transaction is a series of operations that must be completed as a single  indivisible unit.  In other words  a transaction is a set of actions that must be performed as a whole  or not at all. Transaction processing systems (TPS) are commonly used in business and finance to manage the flow of data and information.  In these systems  a transaction may involve adding  updating  or deleting records in a database  or executing financial transactions such as processing payments  issuing invoices  and recording receipts. The basic steps of transaction processing include:Begin Transaction: The system initiates a transaction and begins to execute a series of operations. Execute Operations: The system executes the operations or steps required for the transaction. Commit Transaction: If all operations are successful  the transaction is committed  and the system records the changes to the database. Rollback Transaction: If an error occurs during any of the operations  the transaction is rolled back  and the system undoes all of the changes made during the transaction. The use of transaction processing systems ensures data consistency and accuracy  as well as maintaining the integrity of the system.  Additionally  transaction processing systems enable businesses to manage high-volume  complex transactions efficiently and effectively  which helps to minimize errors  reduce processing time  and improve customer satisfaction.
