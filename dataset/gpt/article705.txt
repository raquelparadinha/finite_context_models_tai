704 An interpreter is a computer program that translates and executes code written in a high-level programming language.  Unlike a compiler  which translates the entire program into machine code before executing it  an interpreter executes the code line by line  as it is encountered in the program. As the interpreter executes each line of code  it converts the code into machine-readable instructions that can be executed by the computer's CPU.  This process is known as interpretation  and it allows developers to test and debug their code quickly and easily  without the need to compile the entire program each time a change is made. Interpreters are commonly used in scripting languages  such as Python and Ruby  which are designed to be easy to learn and use.  They are also used in languages such as JavaScript and PHP  which are commonly used in web development  as they can be executed directly in a web browser or on a web server. One disadvantage of using an interpreter is that it can be slower than using a compiler  as the interpreter must execute each line of code as it is encountered.  However  interpreters offer many advantages in terms of ease of use and rapid development  making them a popular choice for many developers.
