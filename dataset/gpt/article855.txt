854 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a system of hardware  software  and policies used to manage digital certificates and public-private key pairs used in cryptographic systems. PKI uses asymmetric encryption algorithms to generate public and private keys for use in secure communication.  The public key can be freely shared with anyone  while the private key is kept secret by the key owner.  A digital certificate is used to bind a public key to the identity of the key owner  such as a website or an individual. PKI systems provide a secure method for verifying the identity of users and devices  ensuring the integrity of data in transit  and enabling secure communication between parties.  They are used in a variety of applications  including secure web browsing (via HTTPS)  email encryption  and secure online transactions. PKI is based on a hierarchical trust model  where trusted third-party entities called Certificate Authorities (CAs) issue digital certificates to entities that have been verified to be who they claim to be.  The CA's signature on the certificate serves as a guarantee of the certificate's authenticity.
