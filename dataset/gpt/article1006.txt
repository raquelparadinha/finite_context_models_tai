1005 Client-server computing offers several advantages over other computing models  including:Centralized control: Client-server architecture allows for a centralized management of data and resources  which can help to improve security and consistency of the data. Scalability: The client-server model is scalable  meaning that additional clients can be added to the system without the need for significant changes to the underlying infrastructure. Resource sharing: The server can act as a centralized resource pool  which allows clients to share resources such as storage  processing power  and memory. Improved performance: Client-server architecture can improve performance by allowing the server to handle complex and resource-intensive tasks  freeing up client resources for other tasks. Improved maintenance and support: Client-server architecture simplifies maintenance and support  as software and data can be centrally managed  updated  and backed up. Platform independence: The client-server model enables platform independence  which means that clients can access the server regardless of the operating system or hardware platform they are running on.
