985 Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) refers to the use of computer-based tools and methods to support software development and engineering activities.  CASE tools are designed to automate and streamline various tasks in the software development process  including requirements analysis  design  coding  testing  and maintenance. CASE tools can be divided into several categories  including:Upper CASE: These tools are used in the early stages of software development to support activities such as requirements analysis  system modeling  and design.  Examples of upper CASE tools include entity-relationship diagrams (ERD)  data flow diagrams (DFD)  and Unified Modeling Language (UML) tools. Lower CASE: These tools are used in the later stages of software development to support activities such as coding  debugging  and testing.  Examples of lower CASE tools include code generators  debuggers  and testing frameworks. Integrated CASE (ICASE): These tools integrate both upper and lower CASE tools  providing a complete software development environment.  ICASE tools often include features such as version control  project management  and team collaboration tools.
