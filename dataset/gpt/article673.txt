672 Web browsers are software applications that allow users to access and navigate the World Wide Web (WWW) by displaying web pages and other online content.  The following are the main functionalities of web browsers:Rendering: A web browser reads the HTML  CSS  and JavaScript code in a web page and uses it to display the content of the page on the user's device.  This process is called rendering. Navigation: Web browsers allow users to navigate through the web by following hyperlinks and entering URLs.  They also provide a back button  which allows users to return to previously visited pages.

For example  web browsers may display warnings when a user visits a suspicious website or block downloads from untrusted sources. Extensions: Many web browsers allow users to install extensions  which are small software programs that add extra functionality to the browser.  Examples of extensions include ad blockers  password managers  and productivity tools. Bookmarks: Web browsers allow users to save bookmarks  which are links to frequently visited web pages.

Users can use their browsing history to revisit pages that they have previously visited. Tabs: Web browsers allow users to open multiple tabs  which are separate instances of the browser window.  Tabs make it easy for users to switch between different web pages without having to open multiple windows.
