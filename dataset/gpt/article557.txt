556 Phishing and spoofing are two common types of online scams used by cybercriminals to trick users into divulging sensitive information such as passwords  credit card numbers  and other personal data. Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where the attacker sends a fraudulent message  typically via email or instant messaging  pretending to be a trustworthy entity  such as a bank  government agency  or online service provider.  The message usually contains a link that takes the user to a fake website that looks like the legitimate one.  Once the user enters their login credentials or personal information  the attacker can use that information for various malicious purposes. Spoofing  on the other hand  involves manipulating the sender's address of an email or other communication to make it appear as if it's coming from a legitimate source  such as a known company or organization.  The goal of spoofing is to trick the recipient into thinking that the communication is legitimate and trustworthy.  This can be used to deliver phishing attacks or to spread malware. In summary  phishing is an attack that tricks users into providing sensitive information by impersonating a legitimate entity  while spoofing involves impersonating a trusted source in order to deceive the recipient into thinking that the communication is legitimate.
