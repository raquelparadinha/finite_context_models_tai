794 FORTRAN (short for FORmula TRANslation) is a high-level programming language that was originally developed by IBM in the 1950s.  It was the first widely used programming language and is still used today in some scientific and engineering applications. FORTRAN was designed to be a language that could be used for scientific and engineering calculations  which often involve complex mathematical formulas.  It was also designed to be efficient  so that it could run on early computers with limited memory and processing power. FORTRAN has evolved over the years and has several versions  including FORTRAN 77  Fortran 90  Fortran 95  and Fortran 2003.  The language has influenced the development of many other programming languages and is still used in areas such as numerical analysis  scientific computing  and simulation.
