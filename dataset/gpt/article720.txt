719 Hacking refers to the act of accessing computer systems or networks without authorization  and the term hacker originally referred to someone who was skilled in computer programming and used their skills to solve problems in creative and innovative ways. The first known instance of hacking occurred in 1960  when a group of students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) explored the limitations of the institution's computer system.  In the following decades  hacking grew in popularity and became associated with both positive and negative activities. In the 1980s  hackers gained notoriety for their involvement in high-profile computer security breaches  such as the Morris Worm  which affected thousands of computers.  This led to the passage of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the United States in 1986  which made computer hacking a federal crime. Since then  the field of cybersecurity has evolved to protect against hacking and other types of cyberattacks.  However  hacking and hackers continue to pose a threat to computer systems and networks  and both ethical and unethical hacking are still practiced today
