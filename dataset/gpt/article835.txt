834 Web cache  also known as a browser cache or HTTP cache  is a technology used by web browsers and web servers to improve the speed and efficiency of web page access. When a web page is loaded  the web browser typically downloads all of the associated resources  such as images  scripts  and stylesheets  from the web server.  With web cache  the browser can store a local copy of these resources in cache memory  so that if the user returns to the same page  the browser can load the resources from cache instead of re-downloading them from the server.  This can result in faster page load times  reduced network traffic  and lower server load. Web cache works by utilizing the available memory in a computer's RAM to store frequently accessed web page resources.  The cache can be managed by the web browser  which determines which resources should be cached based on their access patterns and available memory.  Web cache can also be implemented at the server level  where the server stores a cache of frequently accessed pages or resources to reduce server load and improve response times.
