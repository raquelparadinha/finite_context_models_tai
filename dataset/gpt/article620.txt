619 Quick sort is a widely-used sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array of elements.  The algorithm works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two subarrays  according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.  The pivot element is then placed between the two subarrays. The partitioning process is repeated recursively on each of the subarrays until the entire array is sorted.  The two subarrays are sorted independently using quick sort. Quick sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case and O(n^2) in the worst case.  However  it is generally faster than other sorting algorithms for large arrays due to its efficient use of memory and cache.  It is widely used in practice and is often the sorting algorithm of choice for many programming languages and applications.
