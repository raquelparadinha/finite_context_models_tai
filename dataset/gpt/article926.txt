925 Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the essential features or interfaces that other objects need to interact with it. In encapsulation  the internal state of an object is kept private  and can only be accessed or modified through the object's public methods or interfaces.  This protects the integrity of the object's data and ensures that it is accessed and modified in a controlled  safe manner.
