658 Ubiquitous computing  also known as pervasive computing  refers to the concept of integrating computing and communication technologies into everyday objects and environments to create a seamless and interconnected computing experience.  Here are some examples of ubiquitous computing:Smart homes: Home automation systems that control lighting  heating  and security systems  as well as appliances and entertainment devices  through a single interface. Wearable technology: Devices such as smartwatches  fitness trackers  and augmented reality glasses that provide users with real-time information and interact with the environment. Intelligent transportation systems: Technologies such as GPS navigation  traffic management systems  and driver assistance features that enhance safety and efficiency on the roads. Health monitoring systems: Wearable devices that track vital signs and fitness data  as well as remote health monitoring systems that allow healthcare providers to monitor patients' health status in real-time. Smart cities: Urban environments that leverage data and technology to improve public services and enhance the quality of life for residents  such as traffic management  waste management  and public safety systems. Industrial internet of things (IIoT): Networks of interconnected devices and sensors in manufacturing plants and other industrial settings that enable real-time monitoring and control of operations. Ambient computing: Smart environments that use sensors and AI to provide personalized and context-aware experiences  such as smart offices and retail spaces. These are just a few examples of ubiquitous computing  and the possibilities for integrating computing technologies into our everyday lives are virtually limitless.
