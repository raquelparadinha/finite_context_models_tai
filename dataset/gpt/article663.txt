662 VBScript  or Visual Basic Scripting Edition  is a scripting language developed by Microsoft that is based on the Visual Basic programming language.  It is designed to be easy to learn and use  and it is often used to automate tasks in Windows environments. VBScript is a lightweight language that can be embedded in HTML pages  Windows applications  and other software products.  It can also be used to write Windows Script Host scripts  which can automate tasks on a Windows machine. VBScript supports a variety of programming constructs  including variables  data types  control structures  functions  and subroutines.  It also has built-in support for a wide range of Windows system functions  such as file and folder manipulation  registry access  and network communication. While VBScript was once a popular scripting language  it has largely been replaced by newer languages such as PowerShell and JavaScript.  However  it is still supported on many Windows systems  and there are many legacy scripts and applications that use VBScript.
