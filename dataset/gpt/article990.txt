989 Recordable CDs  also known as CD-Rs  are a type of optical disc that can be written to or recorded with digital data  such as music  video  or software.  Unlike read-only CD-ROMs  CD-Rs can be used to store new data and are widely used for data backup  archiving  and distribution. A recordable CD is similar in appearance to a CD-ROM  with a diameter of 120 mm (4. 7 inches) and a thickness of 1. 2 mm (0. 05 inches).  The disc is made of a polycarbonate substrate coated with a layer of dye and a layer of reflective material.  When the disc is burned  the laser beam heats up the dye and creates microscopic pits and lands that can be read by a CD player or drive.
