938 A data acquisition system typically consists of the following components:Sensors/Transducers: These are devices that convert physical parameters  such as temperature  pressure  or humidity  into electrical signals. Signal Conditioning: This component prepares the electrical signals from the sensors for digitization.  It may include amplification  filtering  isolation  or other signal processing techniques. Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC): The ADC converts the analog electrical signals from the sensors into digital signals that can be processed by a computer or other digital device. Data Storage: This component stores the digital signals for later analysis.  It may include hard drives  solid-state drives  memory cards  or other storage devices. Data Transmission: This component transmits the digital signals from the data acquisition system to a computer or other digital device for further analysis. Computer Interface: This component connects the data acquisition system to a computer or other digital device.  It may include a USB  Ethernet  or other type of interface. Software: The software controls the data acquisition system and manages the data acquisition process.  It may include drivers for the data acquisition hardware  data logging software  or other applications.
