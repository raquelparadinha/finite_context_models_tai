518 The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual model that describes the communication process between computing systems.  It is composed of seven layers  each of which defines a specific function in the communication process.  The layers are:Physical layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting raw data between devices using physical connections like cables  wires  or radio signals.  It defines the electrical and physical specifications for the connection. Data link layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting data between devices on the same physical network.  It defines how data is organized into frames for transmission and how errors are detected and corrected. Network layer: This layer is responsible for routing data between different networks.  It determines the optimal path for data to travel and uses protocols like IP (Internet Protocol) to transmit data between networks. Transport layer: This layer provides reliable  end-to-end communication between devices.  It breaks down data into smaller packets for transmission and ensures that they are received correctly at the other end. Session layer: This layer establishes  manages  and terminates connections between devices.  It allows applications on different devices to establish a communication session and manage the exchange of data. Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for data representation and encryption.  It transforms data into a format that can be understood by the application layer and encrypts it for secure transmission. Application layer: This layer provides services to end-users  such as email  file transfer  and web browsing.  It defines the protocols and formats used by applications to communicate with each other. The OSI model is a reference model and does not specify any particular protocol or technology.  However  it provides a common framework that helps network designers and developers to understand the various functions and interactions between different layers of the network.
