545 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that is used to convert printed or handwritten text into digital text.  OCR systems are designed to scan an image containing text and use algorithms to recognize and convert the text into a digital format that can be edited  searched  or processed by a computer. OCR technology typically works by analyzing the shapes of characters in an image and comparing them to a database of known character shapes.  The system then uses pattern recognition algorithms to match the characters in the image to the closest match in the database.  Once the characters have been identified  the OCR system converts them into digital text that can be edited or searched. OCR technology is used in a wide range of applications  including document scanning and conversion  automated data entry  and text recognition in images and videos.  OCR is commonly used to convert printed text from books  magazines  and newspapers into digital formats  and is also used in industries such as healthcare  finance  and legal services to digitize and process large volumes of text-based documents.
