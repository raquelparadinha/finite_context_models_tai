693 Memory management is a critical component of any computer system  and its role is to manage the use of memory to ensure that programs have the memory they need to function properly  while avoiding issues such as memory leaks and out-of-memory errors. Memory management is responsible for allocating memory to programs and processes as needed  as well as deallocating memory that is no longer being used.  This involves managing a pool of available memory and determining which portions of the memory should be assigned to each program. The memory manager also ensures that each program only accesses the memory that has been allocated to it  and that no program can access memory that belongs to another program.  This is important for maintaining the stability and security of the system. Memory management also plays a role in optimizing the use of memory in a system.  This can involve techniques such as swapping memory contents to and from disk when memory is running low  or compressing memory to make better use of the available space. In short  the role of memory management is to ensure that the system has enough memory to run all its programs and processes  and that memory is used efficiently and securely.  Memory management is a complex and critical component of any computer system  and its proper operation is essential for the overall stability and performance of the system.
