977 n computing  cache refers to a high-speed data storage layer that stores recently used data and instructions to provide faster access to that data in the future. When data is requested by a program  the computer first checks if the data is available in the cache memory.  If it is  the computer retrieves the data from the cache instead of going to the original source  such as the hard drive or network  which is slower.  This results in faster access to frequently used data  which in turn improves the overall performance of the computer system. Caches can be found in many different parts of a computer system  including the processor  hard drive  and web browser.  They can be either hardware-based  such as a processor cache  or software-based  such as a web browser cache.
