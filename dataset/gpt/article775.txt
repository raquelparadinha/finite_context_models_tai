774 File transfer protocols are methods for transferring files over a network  such as the internet.  There are several different file transfer protocols in use today  each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some common file transfer protocols include:FTP (File Transfer Protocol): A standard protocol used for transferring files between computers on a network.  FTP is a relatively simple protocol  but it is not secure and does not support encryption. SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol): A more secure version of FTP that encrypts data during transfer.  SFTP is often used for transferring sensitive data  such as financial or medical records. FTPS (FTP over SSL): Another secure version of FTP that encrypts data during transfer.  FTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption  which is commonly used for secure web connections. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The protocol used for transferring data over the web  including web pages  images  and other types of files.  While not specifically designed for file transfer  HTTP can be used to transfer files  particularly smaller files. HTTPS (HTTP Secure): A secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data during transfer.  HTTPS is commonly used for secure web connections and is often used for transferring sensitive data. SCP (Secure Copy Protocol): A secure file transfer protocol that uses SSH (Secure Shell) to encrypt data during transfer.  SCP is commonly used for transferring files between Unix/Linux servers.
