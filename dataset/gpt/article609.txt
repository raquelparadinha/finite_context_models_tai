608 A smart card  also known as an integrated circuit card (ICC) or a chip card  is a small plastic card with a built-in microprocessor chip that stores and processes data.  Smart cards are used for a variety of applications  such as payment  identification  access control  and transportation. Smart cards have several advantages over traditional magnetic stripe cards  such as:Enhanced Security: Smart cards provide a higher level of security than magnetic stripe cards as the microprocessor chip is capable of storing and processing encrypted data.  This makes it more difficult for fraudsters to copy or tamper with the data stored on the card. Multiple Applications: Smart cards can store and process multiple types of data  such as personal information  financial data  and access credentials.  This makes it possible to use a single card for different applications  such as payment  identification  and access control. Offline Authentication: Smart cards can perform offline authentication  which means that the card can verify the identity of the user without the need for an online connection.  This makes smart cards ideal for applications such as access control and transportation. Convenient and Portable: Smart cards are small and lightweight  making them easy to carry around.  They can also be used with a variety of devices  such as card readers  point-of-sale terminals  and mobile phones. Some examples of smart card applications include credit and debit cards  national ID cards  health cards  transit cards  and access control cards.
