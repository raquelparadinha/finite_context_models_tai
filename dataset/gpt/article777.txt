776 The role of computers in the film industry began in the 1970s with the advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI).  At that time  computers were used primarily to generate simple 2D graphics and effects  such as titles and special effects for TV commercials. In the 1980s  the capabilities of computers improved  and they began to be used for more complex 3D graphics and effects in films.  One of the first films to use computer-generated imagery extensively was Tron (1982)  which used CGI to create the film's distinctive digital world. As the technology continued to improve  the use of CGI in films became more widespread  with films like Jurassic Park (1993) and The Matrix (1999) using advanced CGI to create realistic creatures and special effects. Today  computers play a vital role in nearly every aspect of the film industry  from pre-production to post-production.  They are used to create and edit scripts  design sets and costumes  film and edit footage  and create special effects and visual effects.  Additionally  computers are used for marketing and distribution  such as creating trailers and promoting films on social media and streaming platforms.
