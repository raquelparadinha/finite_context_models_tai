808 The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that performs arithmetic and logical operations.  The ALU is responsible for performing basic calculations and comparisons  such as addition  subtraction  multiplication  division  and logic operations such as AND  OR  NOT  XOR  and others.  The ALU receives inputs from the CPU's internal register and memory  performs the specified operation  and then stores the result back in the register or memory.  The operation performed by the ALU is determined by the instruction sent to the CPU by the computer's software.  The performance and efficiency of the ALU are critical to the overall performance of the computer  as it is responsible for executing the majority of the operations performed by the CPU.  The design of the ALU  including the number of bits it can operate on and the number of operations it can perform in a single clock cycle  is an important factor in determining the performance of the computer.  In modern computers  the ALU is integrated into the CPU as part of the digital circuit  and its design is constantly being improved to increase performance and efficiency.
