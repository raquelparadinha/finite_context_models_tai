790 In computers  the word font refers to a set of characters (letters  numbers  symbols  and punctuation marks) that share a similar design or style.  These characters are usually used to create text on a computer screen or in printed documents. Fonts are typically created by designers or type foundries and are stored as digital files on a computer.  Each font file contains information about the shapes and sizes of the characters  as well as information about the spacing between characters and other typographic features. In software applications such as word processors or graphics editors  users can select a font from a list and apply it to the text they are working on.  This will change the appearance of the text to match the selected font's style and design.  There are a wide variety of fonts available for use  ranging from simple and traditional to ornate and decorative.
