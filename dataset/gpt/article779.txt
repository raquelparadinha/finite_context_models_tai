778 Finite state machines (FSMs) have a wide range of applications in many fields  including computer science  engineering  natural language processing  and more.  Here are some common applications of FSMs:Control Systems: FSMs are often used to control the behavior of a system based on its inputs and internal state.  This includes digital circuits  robotics  and automation systems. Software Engineering: FSMs are used in software design and development to model the behavior of complex systems  such as network protocols  user interfaces  and video games. Natural Language Processing: FSMs are used to model the behavior of natural language grammars  allowing for the recognition and generation of sentences in a particular language. Compiler Design: FSMs are used in the lexing and parsing phases of compiler design  where they help to identify and group tokens in the input language. Pattern Recognition: FSMs are used in machine learning and image processing to recognize patterns in data  such as speech  handwriting  and facial recognition. Verification and Testing: FSMs are used to verify the correctness of a system or software design by modeling its behavior and checking it against a given specification or set of requirements.
