655 In computer science  a tree is a widely-used data structure that represents a hierarchical structure or an abstract model of a set of elements.  It is called a tree because it resembles a tree that has a root at the top and branches that spread out in different directions. A tree consists of nodes  which are connected by edges or links.  The topmost node in a tree is called the root  and each node in a tree has zero or more child nodes.  Nodes with no child nodes are called leaves. In a binary tree  each node has at most two child nodes  which are called left and right children.  In contrast  a general tree can have any number of child nodes. Trees are used in a wide range of applications  including computer science  data structures  algorithms  and programming languages.  Some common applications of trees include representing file systems  representing hierarchical data  organizing data for searching and sorting  and implementing decision-making algorithms such as decision trees and game trees.
