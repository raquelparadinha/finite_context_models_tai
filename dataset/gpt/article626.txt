625 Spyware and adware are types of malicious software designed to collect information about a user's online activities without their knowledge or consent. Spyware is a type of software that secretly monitors a user's computer activity  such as web browsing  keystrokes  and email conversations.  The information collected by spyware is often sent to third-party advertisers or other malicious actors for the purpose of targeted advertising or identity theft. Adware  on the other hand  is software that displays unwanted ads on a user's computer.  These ads can appear in pop-up windows  banners  or even as fake system messages.  Adware is often bundled with free software or downloads  and the ads can be difficult to remove without specialized software. Both spyware and adware are considered harmful to computer systems and user privacy  and it's important to take steps to prevent and remove them.  This includes using anti-virus and anti-malware software  avoiding suspicious downloads  and keeping software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
