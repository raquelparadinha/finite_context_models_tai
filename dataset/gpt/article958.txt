957 In computing  a demon (sometimes spelled daemon) is a computer program or process that runs in the background and performs specific tasks or services without requiring user intervention.  Demons are typically used in operating systems and network servers to manage resources  monitor system performance  and provide various types of services. One of the key characteristics of a demon is that it runs continuously in the background  waiting for specific events or conditions to occur before it executes a particular task.  For example  a network demon might monitor network traffic and respond to specific types of requests  such as file transfers or email messages.  A system demon might manage system resources such as memory or disk space  or perform regular maintenance tasks such as backups or system updates. Demons are often associated with Unix and Unix-like operating systems  where they are managed by the system's init process.  In these systems  demons are typically started at boot time and run continuously until the system is shut down or the demon is explicitly stopped. The term demon is sometimes used interchangeably with the term service or background process.  However  in some contexts  demon specifically refers to a program or process that runs continuously and provides a specific type of service or functionality  while service may refer more generally to any program or process that provides a service or function on a computer system.
