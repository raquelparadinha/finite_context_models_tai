724 Hashing has many applications in computer science  but two major ones are:Data Storage and Retrieval: Hashing is used for efficient data storage and retrieval in many applications.  Hash tables are widely used data structures that store data in a way that allows for fast lookups  insertions  and deletions.  In a hash table  data elements are stored based on their keys  and a hash function is used to map the keys to an index in an array.  This makes it easy to quickly access a data element given its key  and the time complexity of basic operations like insertions and lookups is typically O(1) on average. Data Authentication and Verification: Hashing is also used for data authentication and verification.  When a hash function is applied to a message or data file  it generates a fixed-length hash value that is unique to the input data.  This makes it possible to verify that the data has not been tampered with or corrupted in any way  as any changes to the input data will result in a different hash value.  Hashing is widely used for password storage  where passwords are hashed and stored in a database  and for digital signatures  where a hash of a document or message is signed to ensure its authenticity and integrity.
