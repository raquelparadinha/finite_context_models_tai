979 Disk cache is a mechanism used by computer operating systems to improve disk I/O (input/output) performance. When a program reads data from a disk  the operating system caches the data in memory  so that the next time the program needs to access the same data  it can be retrieved quickly from memory instead of having to read it from the disk again.  Similarly  when a program writes data to a disk  the operating system caches the data in memory and writes it to the disk at a later time when it is more efficient to do so. The disk cache can be either a dedicated portion of RAM or a portion of the hard drive that has been set aside for this purpose.  By caching frequently accessed data in memory  the operating system can reduce the amount of time spent waiting for disk I/O operations  which can improve overall system performance.
