1006 Clock speed  also known as clock rate  refers to the frequency at which a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can execute instructions.  It is measured in Hertz (Hz)  and typically expressed in Gigahertz (GHz) for modern CPUs. Clock speed represents the number of clock cycles per second that the CPU can execute.  Each clock cycle represents a single unit of work that the CPU can perform.  A higher clock speed means that the CPU can perform more work in a given amount of time  which can result in improved performance. However  clock speed is not the only factor that determines CPU performance.  Other factors  such as the number of cores  cache size  and instruction set  also play an important role in determining overall performance.
