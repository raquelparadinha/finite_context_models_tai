820 ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is a type of broadband internet connection technology that uses existing copper telephone lines to transmit digital data at high speeds.  ADSL allows users to access the internet and other online services while still being able to make phone calls on the same line. ADSL is asymmetric because it allows for faster download speeds than upload speeds.  This is because it is designed to accommodate the typical internet usage patterns of most people  who tend to download more data than they upload.  In an ADSL connection  the bandwidth is divided into two channels  with one channel being used for downloading data at high speeds  while the other channel is used for uploading data at lower speeds. ADSL requires a special modem to be installed on the user's premises  which communicates with the internet service provider's (ISP) equipment at the telephone exchange.  The modem uses a technology called frequency division multiplexing (FDM) to separate the voice and data signals on the same phone line. ADSL is widely available and is one of the most popular types of broadband internet connections worldwide.  It is generally less expensive than other high-speed internet options like fiber-optic internet and cable internet  and it is suitable for many common online activities  such as web browsing  streaming video and audio  and online gaming.  However  ADSL speeds can be affected by factors like the distance from the user's premises to the telephone exchange and the quality of the phone line  which can result in slower speeds in some cases.
