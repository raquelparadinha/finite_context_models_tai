583 RSS  or Really Simple Syndication  was developed in the late 1990s as a way to easily distribute content from websites to other sites or individuals.  The first version of RSS was created by Netscape in 1999  but it was later refined and standardized by Dave Winer and others at UserLand Software. In 2002  RSS 2. 0 was released  which became the most widely adopted version of the format.  RSS 2. 0 introduced new features such as support for enclosures (which allowed podcasts and other media to be distributed through RSS)  and improved support for metadata and internationalization. In the mid-2000s  RSS became increasingly popular as a way to follow blogs and news sites.  Many popular blogging platforms  such as WordPress and TypePad  included built-in support for RSS feeds  making it easy for users to subscribe to updates.  RSS readers and feed aggregators such as Feedly and Google Reader also gained popularity during this time. However  the popularity of RSS declined in the late 2000s and early 2010s as social media and other content distribution channels such as email newsletters became more popular.  Some major websites  such as Facebook and Twitter  stopped supporting RSS feeds entirely. Despite its decline in usage  RSS remains a useful tool for distributing and consuming content on the web  particularly for niche or specialized content that may not be easily discoverable through other channels.
