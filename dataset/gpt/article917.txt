916 Eiffel refers to the Eiffel programming language  which is a high-level  object-oriented programming language designed by Bertrand Meyer in the mid-1980s.  The language is named after Gustave Eiffel  the French engineer who designed the Eiffel Tower. Eiffel is known for its focus on software engineering principles such as design-by-contract  automatic memory management  and the use of the Uniform Access Principle.  The language's syntax is designed to be simple  readable  and expressive  with features that encourage modular programming  extensibility  and maintainability. Eiffel is commonly used in developing mission-critical software systems  such as aerospace  finance  and medical applications  where reliability  safety  and security are of paramount importance.  The language is also used in education and research  particularly in the study of software engineering and formal methods.
