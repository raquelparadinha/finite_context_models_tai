887 Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip will double every two years while the cost of producing these chips will decrease  leading to a rapid increase in computing power and decrease in cost of electronics.  It has been a driving force behind technology advancement and the development of new technologies  but its future is uncertain due to physical and economic limitations.
