850 A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker attempts to make a network  website  or service unavailable to users by overwhelming it with traffic or other forms of disruptive activity. DoS attacks typically involve flooding a targeted system with a large volume of traffic  such as network packets or web requests  in order to consume the system's resources and make it unavailable to legitimate users.  Attackers may also use other methods to disrupt the targeted system  such as sending malformed data  exploiting vulnerabilities in the system's software  or launching attacks from multiple sources to make it more difficult to block the traffic. DoS attacks can be launched from a single source or from multiple sources  in which case it is called a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.  DDoS attacks are typically carried out using botnets  which are networks of compromised computers that are controlled remotely by the attacker. DoS attacks can have serious consequences for organizations  including lost revenue  damage to reputation  and legal liability.  To protect against DoS attacks  organizations can implement measures such as network filtering  load balancing  and anti-DDoS software  as well as practicing good security hygiene  such as keeping software up-to-date and using strong authentication methods.
