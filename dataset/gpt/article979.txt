978 The CPU cache is a small and fast memory storage area located on the processor chip that is used to store frequently used data and instructions.  Its purpose is to speed up the processing time of the CPU by reducing the number of times it needs to access the slower main memory or RAM. When a program requests data or instructions from the main memory  the CPU first checks if the requested data or instruction is present in the cache.  If it is  the CPU retrieves the data from the cache instead of going to the main memory.  This process is much faster because the cache is located on the processor chip and has a much shorter access time than the main memory.
