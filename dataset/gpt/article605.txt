604 In computing  a shell is a program that provides a user interface for accessing an operating system's services and resources.  The shell acts as an intermediary between the user and the operating system  allowing the user to interact with the system by issuing commands and receiving feedback and results. A shell can be thought of as a command interpreter or command-line interface that allows users to enter commands and execute them on the operating system.  The shell also provides access to utilities and programs installed on the system  allowing users to perform tasks such as file management  process management  and system configuration. There are several different types of shells  including the Bourne shell (sh)  the C shell (csh)  the Korn shell (ksh)  and the Bash shell (bash)  which is the default shell for most Linux and Unix-based operating systems.  Each shell has its own set of commands and syntax  but they all provide similar functionality and are designed to make it easier for users to interact with the operating system. In addition to providing a command-line interface  some shells also support graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and other advanced features such as scripting and automation.  Shells are an important part of the computing ecosystem  and are used by system administrators  developers  and power users to perform a wide variety of tasks and operations.
