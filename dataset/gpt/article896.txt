895 Port Address Translation (PAT)  also known as Network Address Port Translation (NAPT)  is a technique used in computer networking to allow multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address. PAT works by assigning a unique port number to each device on the private network  which allows the router to keep track of which device is associated with each incoming or outgoing connection.  When a device on the private network initiates a connection to the internet  the router replaces the private IP address of the device with the public IP address of the router  and uses the unique port number to identify the device. PAT is commonly used in small office or home networks  where a limited number of public IP addresses are available  and multiple devices need to access the internet simultaneously.  It's also used by internet service providers (ISPs) to conserve public IP addresses and manage network traffic. Overall  PAT is a useful technique for managing network resources and allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address.
