761 There are several ways to achieve fault tolerance in computing systems.  Some common techniques include:Redundancy: This involves duplicating critical components or systems and configuring them to take over in the event of a failure.  For example  a fault-tolerant computer system may use multiple processors  hard drives  and network interfaces to ensure that there are backup components available to take over in case of failure. Replication: This involves maintaining multiple copies of critical data or software across different systems or locations.  If one copy becomes unavailable or corrupted  another copy can be used in its place. Error detection and correction: This involves using techniques such as checksums  parity bits  or error-correcting codes to detect and correct errors in data or transmissions.  This can help prevent data corruption or loss caused by hardware or software failures. Graceful degradation: This involves designing a system to continue functioning at a reduced level of performance or capacity in the event of a failure.  This can be useful in situations where complete redundancy is not feasible or cost-effective  such as in mobile devices or cloud computing environments. Load balancing: This involves distributing workloads across multiple systems to prevent any one system from becoming overwhelmed or failing.  Load balancing can help ensure that a system remains available and responsive even in the face of high demand or unexpected failures.
