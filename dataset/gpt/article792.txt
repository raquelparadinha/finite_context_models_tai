791 There are two primary ways to store font data in computers:Bitmap fonts: Bitmap fonts  also known as raster fonts  store the glyph shapes as a bitmap image.  Each character is represented by a set of pixels  with each pixel representing either the foreground or background of the character.  Bitmap fonts are typically smaller in file size and can be quickly displayed on screen  but they can appear jagged or pixelated when enlarged or printed at high resolutions. Outline fonts: Outline fonts  also known as vector fonts  store the glyph shapes as mathematical outlines that describe the shapes of the characters.  The outlines are usually defined using Bezier curves  which can be scaled and adjusted without losing quality.  Outline fonts are typically larger in file size and can take longer to render on screen  but they offer greater flexibility and can be printed at high resolutions without appearing jagged or pixelated.
