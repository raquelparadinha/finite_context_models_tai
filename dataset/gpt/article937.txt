936 There are several advantages of using data abstraction in software development  including:Simplifies complexity: Data abstraction simplifies the complexity of a software system by breaking it down into smaller  more manageable components.  By abstracting away the details of how data is stored and manipulated  developers can focus on the essential properties and behaviors of the data. Enhances modularity: By encapsulating data within objects or abstract data types  data abstraction promotes modularity and information hiding.  This makes it easier to develop and maintain large software systems  as changes made to one part of the system are less likely to affect other parts of the system. Improves code reusability: Data abstraction makes it easier to reuse code in different parts of a software system  as the same data structures and functions can be used in different contexts without requiring significant modification. Enhances security: By hiding the implementation details of data  data abstraction can help to enhance security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Facilitates testing and debugging: Data abstraction can make it easier to test and debug software systems  as it provides a clear separation between the interface and implementation of data structures and functions.  This can make it easier to identify and isolate errors or bugs within the system.
