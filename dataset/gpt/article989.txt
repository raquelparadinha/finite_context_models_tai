988 CD-ROM stands for Compact Disc Read-Only Memory.  It is a type of optical disc used to store digital data  such as software  music  video  and documents. A CD-ROM disc is a round  flat disc made of plastic with a diameter of 120 mm (4. 7 inches) and a thickness of 1. 2 mm (0. 05 inches).  The disc is coated with a thin layer of aluminum or silver  and the data is stored on the disc as microscopic pits and lands.  The disc is read by a laser beam in a CD-ROM drive  which detects the differences in reflectivity between the pits and lands. CD-ROMs have a capacity of up to 700 MB of data  which is equivalent to about 80 minutes of audio.  They were first introduced in 1985 and quickly became popular for distributing software and other digital content.  CD-ROMs are widely used because they are inexpensive  portable  and can be read by a wide range of devices  including computers  game consoles  and standalone CD players.
