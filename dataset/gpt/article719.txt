718 Image processing is a field of study that involves the use of computer algorithms and techniques to manipulate  analyze  and enhance digital images.  It involves a wide range of tasks  such as image filtering  segmentation  feature extraction  pattern recognition  and image compression. Digital images can come from a variety of sources  such as digital cameras  satellite imagery  medical imaging devices  or scientific instruments.  Image processing techniques can be used to improve the quality and clarity of these images  to extract meaningful information from them  or to enable new applications and insights. Some common applications of image processing include:Medical imagingRobotics and automationVideo surveillance and securityArt and entertainmentImage processing is a complex and multidisciplinary field  drawing on knowledge from computer science  mathematics  physics  and engineering.  As digital imagery continues to play an increasingly important role in our lives  the demand for image processing techniques and applications is expected to grow.
