1008 A codec (short for coder-decoder) is a technology used to compress and decompress digital media such as audio and video.  The purpose of a codec is to reduce the file size of digital media without significantly degrading its quality. There are two types of codecs: lossy and lossless.  Lossy codecs are designed to reduce file size by discarding some of the original data  resulting in a smaller file but a loss of quality.  Lossless codecs  on the other hand  compress the data without discarding any of it  resulting in a smaller file but no loss of quality. Codecs are used in a variety of applications  such as streaming media over the internet  video conferencing  and recording and playing back digital media.  Some examples of popular codecs include H. 264 for video and MP3 for audio. In order for digital media to be played back or edited  the appropriate codec must be installed on the computer or device.  Codecs can be proprietary  meaning they are owned by a particular company and require licensing  or open source  meaning they are freely available for use by anyone.
