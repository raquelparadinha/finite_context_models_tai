750 TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a file format used to store and exchange digital images.  It was developed by Aldus Corporation in the 1980s and is widely used in the printing  publishing  and graphic design industries. TIFF files can store both grayscale and color images  as well as images with transparency.  They use a lossless compression method  which means that the image quality is not compromised during compression.
