627 In computer science  a stack is an abstract data type that represents a collection of elements  where the elements are stored and retrieved based on a last-in  first-out (LIFO) principle. This means that the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.  Think of a stack of plates; you can only remove the top plate  and to add another plate  it must be placed on top. A stack has two main operations: push and pop.  The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack  while the pop operation removes the most recently added element from the top of the stack.  Other operations on a stack can include peek  which retrieves the most recently added element without removing it  and is_empty  which checks if the stack contains any elements. Stacks are commonly used in programming  especially for implementing recursive algorithms  maintaining a history of function calls  and evaluating expressions.  They are also used in many other applications  such as compilers  operating systems  and web browsers.
