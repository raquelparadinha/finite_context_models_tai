952 There are many types of data structures  each with its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific application.  Here are some common types of data structures:Arrays: A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. Linked lists: A data structure in which each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next element. Trees: A hierarchical data structure in which each element (node) has one parent node and zero or more child nodes. Graphs: A data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges connecting them  used to represent relationships between objects. Hash tables: A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values  providing fast access to elements. Queues: A collection of elements in which elements are added at one end (the back) and removed from the other end (the front) in a first-in  first-out (FIFO) order. Stacks: A collection of elements in which elements are added and removed from the same end (the top) in a last-in  first-out (LIFO) order.
