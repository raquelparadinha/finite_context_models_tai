908 Signature-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are security mechanisms that examine network traffic or system logs for specific patterns or signatures that match known security threats  such as viruses  worms  or other malware.  These patterns or signatures are typically derived from previous attacks and are stored in a database within the IDS.  When the IDS detects a signature match  it generates an alert or takes other predefined actions to mitigate the threat.  Signature-based IDS can be effective at detecting known attacks  but they are limited to identifying only those attacks for which signatures exist.  New or unknown attacks may not be detected by these systems.  As such  signature-based IDS are often used in conjunction with other security measures  such as behavior-based IDS and firewalls  to provide a more comprehensive defense against cyber threats.
