870 Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is a network authentication protocol used to verify the identity of a user or device attempting to access a network.  CHAP operates by first establishing a connection between the client and server  after which the server sends a challenge message to the client. The challenge is a random number or string that is combined with a secret key  known only to the client and server.  The client then generates a response message by applying a one-way hashing function to the challenge and secret key  and sends it back to the server. The server uses the same hashing function and secret key to independently generate its own expected response  and compares it to the response received from the client.  If the two responses match  the client is authenticated and granted access to the network. CHAP provides a more secure form of authentication than simpler protocols such as Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)  which sends passwords in clear text.  CHAP also supports periodic re-authentication during a session to prevent unauthorized access. Overall  CHAP is a widely used network authentication protocol that provides a higher level of security and authentication than simpler protocols.
