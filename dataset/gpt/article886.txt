885 A logic bomb is a type of malicious code or software that is intentionally inserted into a computer system to perform a specific action or cause damage at a predetermined time or under specific conditions.  Logic bombs can be programmed to execute when certain conditions are met  such as when a specific date or time is reached  when a certain program is executed  or when a specific user performs a certain action. The purpose of a logic bomb is often to cause damage or disrupt normal system operations  such as by deleting files  corrupting data  or shutting down critical services.  Logic bombs can be difficult to detect and prevent  as they can be designed to lie dormant for long periods of time before executing. Logic bombs are illegal and considered a serious threat to computer security.  They are often used by hackers  disgruntled employees  or other malicious actors to cause damage or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.  Preventative measures against logic bombs include regularly updating system software and monitoring system activity for suspicious behavior.
