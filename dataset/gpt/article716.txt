715 Intellectual property (IP) refers to intangible creations of the human mind that can be legally protected  including inventions  literary and artistic works  symbols  names  images  and designs. IP includes a wide range of categories  such as patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  and industrial designs.  Each category has its own legal framework and requirements for protection. IP protection is important because it allows creators and innovators to control and benefit from their ideas and works  and to prevent others from using them without permission or compensation.  This helps to encourage innovation and creativity by providing incentives for individuals and companies to invest time  money  and resources into developing new products and ideas. IP protection is also a complex and evolving area of law  with different rules and practices in different countries and regions.  As digital technologies and the global economy continue to evolve  IP issues such as copyright infringement  trademark disputes  and patent trolls have become more common and more challenging to address.
