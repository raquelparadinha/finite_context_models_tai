813 Active OS fingerprinting is a technique used to identify the operating system running on a remote system or device by sending specific network packets and analyzing the responses.  This technique involves actively probing the target system by sending network packets that elicit specific responses from the operating system. Active OS fingerprinting is typically performed by security professionals or network administrators to identify vulnerable systems and determine the appropriate security measures to protect the network.  Attackers may also use this technique to identify potential targets for exploits or attacks. The process of active OS fingerprinting involves sending a series of specially crafted packets to the target system and analyzing the responses.  The packets may contain specific flags or options that trigger certain responses from the operating system.  These responses can then be compared to a database of known operating system fingerprints to determine the operating system running on the target system. Active OS fingerprinting is considered an invasive technique as it involves actively probing the target system  and it may trigger security alerts or firewalls on the target system.  However  it is often more accurate than passive fingerprinting techniques  which rely on observing network traffic and may be less reliable in some situations.
