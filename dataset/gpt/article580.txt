579 Mobile robots are robots that are designed to move around and operate in different environments.  They can be either fully autonomous  or remotely controlled by a human operator. Mobile robots can come in many different forms  depending on their intended purpose and environment.  Some examples of mobile robots include:Drones - unmanned aerial vehicles that are used for tasks such as aerial photography  delivery  and inspection. Rovers - robots that are used to explore other planets  such as the Mars rovers Spirit  Opportunity  and Curiosity. Autonomous vehicles - self-driving cars and trucks that use sensors and machine learning algorithms to navigate and transport passengers or goods. Humanoid robots - robots that are designed to look and move like humans  such as ASIMO developed by Honda. Quadruped robots - robots that have four legs  such as Boston Dynamics' Spot and SpotMini robots  which are used for inspection  surveillance  and other tasks. Underwater robots - robots that are used for tasks such as oceanographic research  underwater exploration  and pipeline inspection. Mobile robots are becoming increasingly important in many industries  including manufacturing  transportation  logistics  and healthcare.  They offer numerous benefits  such as increased efficiency  improved safety  and greater precision  and are likely to play an increasingly important role in the future as technology continues to advance.
