862 Encryption is a process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it.  In other words  encryption transforms plain text or data into an unreadable format that can only be deciphered with the correct decryption key or password. Encryption is widely used for protecting sensitive data  such as financial transactions  personal information  and confidential communications  from unauthorized access and interception.  Encryption can be applied to data at rest (stored on a device or server) or data in transit (being transmitted over a network). There are two main types of encryption: symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption.  Symmetric encryption uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data  while asymmetric encryption uses two keys  one for encryption and one for decryption. Encryption algorithms vary in their strength and complexity  with stronger encryption algorithms providing a higher level of security but requiring more processing power and resources.  Some common encryption standards include AES  RSA  and DES. Encryption is an important tool for protecting the privacy and security of digital information  and it is used in many different contexts  such as online banking  e-commerce  email communication  and more.
