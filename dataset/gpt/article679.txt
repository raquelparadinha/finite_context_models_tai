678 A web server is a software program that runs on a computer and is responsible for serving web content to clients  typically web browsers.  The working of a web server can be explained in the following steps:A client (a web browser) sends a request to the web server for a particular web page or resource  using the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) protocol.  The request typically contains information such as the type of resource requested  the desired encoding  and any other relevant data. The web server receives the request and analyzes it to determine which resource is being requested  and if it is available on the server.  If the resource is not found  the web server will send a 404 Not Found response to the client. If the resource is found  the web server retrieves it and prepares to send it to the client.  This may involve reading the resource from disk  generating it dynamically using server-side scripting languages like PHP  or retrieving it from a database. The web server sends the resource to the client in the form of an HTTP response.  The response typically includes headers that provide metadata about the resource  such as its content type  length  and encoding. The client receives the response and renders the resource to the user  typically by displaying it in a web browser. Throughout this process  the web server may interact with other servers  databases  or services to fulfill the client's request.  For example  the web server might use a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple servers  or it might authenticate the client's identity using a separate authentication server. Overall  the web server acts as a middleman between the client and the resources it is requesting  handling the low-level details of communication and data transfer to ensure that the client receives the correct content in a timely and efficient manner.
