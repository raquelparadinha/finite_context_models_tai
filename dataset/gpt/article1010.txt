It combines research from psychology  neuroscience  linguistics  philosophy  computer science  and anthropology to understand how the human mind processes information and how we interact with the world around us. Cognitive science seeks to explain how mental processes work at different levels  from the neural level to the behavioral level.  It investigates questions such as: How do we perceive and interpret sensory information? How do we acquire and use knowledge? How do we reason and make decisions? How do we use language to communicate?Cognitive science research often involves experiments and modeling  using techniques from various fields  such as brain imaging  computational modeling  and cognitive psychology.  It has important applications in areas such as education  artificial intelligence  and human-computer interaction.
