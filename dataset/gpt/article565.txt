564 PostScript is a page description language and programming language used primarily in the printing and publishing industries.  It was developed by Adobe Systems and first released in 1984. PostScript works by describing the text and graphics that make up a document in terms of mathematical equations and geometric shapes.  This information is then sent to a PostScript-compatible printer  which uses the equations and shapes to create a high-quality printed document. PostScript also includes features for managing fonts  color  and other aspects of the printed output.  Additionally  it can be used for creating graphics and other visual elements  making it a powerful tool for designers and artists. PostScript has been widely adopted in the printing and publishing industries and is supported by many software applications and hardware devices.  It has also been a key technology in the development of desktop publishing and digital printing.
