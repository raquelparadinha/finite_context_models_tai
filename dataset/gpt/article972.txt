971 Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is a type of broadband internet technology that uses existing telephone lines to provide high-speed internet access.  DSL works by dividing the available bandwidth on a telephone line into two channels: one for voice communication and one for data communication. DSL technology is designed to work with existing copper telephone lines  which are already installed in most homes and businesses.  DSL modems are used to convert the digital signals from a computer into the analog signals used by the telephone line  and vice versa.
