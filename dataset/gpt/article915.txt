914 A stream cipher is a type of encryption algorithm that encrypts data one bit or byte at a time.  It operates on data streams and converts plaintext into ciphertext using a key  which is a sequence of random or pseudorandom bits or bytes.  Unlike block ciphers  which encrypt data in fixed-sized blocks  stream ciphers encrypt data in a continuous stream.  This makes them well-suited for applications where data is transmitted in real-time  such as online streaming or communication systems.  Stream ciphers can be vulnerable to attacks if the key is not properly managed or if the underlying random number generator is weak.
