1007 COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language designed for business applications.  It was first introduced in 1959 and is still widely used today for processing large amounts of data in applications such as banking  insurance  and government. COBOL was designed to be easily readable and understandable by business people  as well as programmers.  It features a rich set of data processing capabilities  including support for complex record structures and file processing. COBOL programs are typically compiled rather than interpreted  and they are often run on mainframe computers.  However  the language has been adapted to run on modern platforms  such as Windows and Unix. Despite its age  COBOL remains an important language in the business world due to its reliability and ability to handle large volumes of data.  It is estimated that billions of lines of COBOL code are still in use today.
