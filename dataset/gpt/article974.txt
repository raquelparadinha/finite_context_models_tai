973 C is a general-purpose  procedural programming language that was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s.  It is widely used for system programming  such as writing operating systems  device drivers  and embedded systems  as well as for developing applications in various domains such as finance  healthcare  and gaming. C is a low-level language  meaning that it provides direct access to computer hardware and system resources  such as memory and CPU registers.  This makes C a powerful language for developing applications that require close control over hardware resources and efficient memory management. C is also a structured language  meaning that it provides constructs for organizing code into logical structures  such as functions  loops  and conditional statements.  This makes it easier to write and maintain complex programs.
