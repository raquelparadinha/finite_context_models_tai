657 Typography was computerized through the development of digital typefaces and the creation of software that allowed users to manipulate and design text on a computer. The process of digitizing typography began in the 1950s with the development of the first computer fonts.  These were initially created as bitmap images  where each letter was represented by a grid of pixels.  As technology advanced  more sophisticated font formats were developed  such as PostScript and TrueType  which allowed for scalable and high-quality typography. In the 1980s and 1990s  software such as Adobe Illustrator  Adobe Photoshop  and QuarkXPress made it possible for designers to create and manipulate typography on a computer.  These programs allowed users to select fonts  adjust kerning and tracking  and create layouts with precision. Today  typography continues to be an integral part of digital design  with a wide range of software and tools available for designers and typographers.  The development of variable fonts has also revolutionized typography by allowing for more customizable and responsive typefaces.
