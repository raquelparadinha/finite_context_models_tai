716 Information theory is a mathematical and computational theory that studies the quantification  storage  transmission  and processing of information.  It was developed by Claude Shannon in the 1940s and 1950s  and it has since become a fundamental tool in fields such as communication  computer science  physics  and cryptography. At its core  information theory seeks to understand the fundamental limits of communication and data processing  and to identify efficient ways of encoding  transmitting  and decoding information.  It provides mathematical tools and models for measuring the amount of information in a message or signal  and for evaluating the reliability and efficiency of different coding and compression techniques. Some key concepts in information theory include entropy  which measures the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a signal; channel capacity  which represents the maximum rate of information that can be transmitted through a communication channel; and error-correcting codes  which are techniques for detecting and correcting errors that can occur during transmission or storage of digital data.
