860 e-Government (Electronic Government) refers to the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by government organizations to provide public services to citizens  businesses  and other government agencies. e-Government aims to improve the efficiency  transparency  and accessibility of government services and operations  as well as enhance citizen participation and engagement in the decision-making process.  Examples of e-Government services include online tax filing  vehicle registration  permit applications  and access to public records. e-Government can also facilitate the exchange of information and data between different government agencies  leading to better coordination and integration of government services. However  implementing e-Government services can also pose challenges related to privacy and security  as well as access to technology and digital literacy among citizens.  Effective e-Government initiatives require careful planning  infrastructure development  and stakeholder engagement to ensure their success.
