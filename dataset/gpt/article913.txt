912 P2P spoofing is a type of network attack that involves disguising malicious traffic as legitimate peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic.  In a P2P network  users connect directly to each other and share files or data without the need for a central server.  P2P spoofing can occur when an attacker uses a software program to mimic a legitimate P2P user  but with malicious intent.  The attacker can then use this fake identity to distribute malware or engage in other malicious activities  such as stealing sensitive information or launching a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.  P2P spoofing can be difficult to detect because it appears to be legitimate traffic.  However  there are methods and tools available to detect and prevent P2P spoofing attacks.
