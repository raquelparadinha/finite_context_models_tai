959 In software engineering  a pattern is a proven solution to a recurring problem in software design.  Patterns help software developers to create efficient  scalable  and maintainable software systems by providing a set of best practices and reusable components. Patterns can be categorized into several types  including:Creational patterns: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms  trying to create objects in a manner that suits the situation the developer is in.  Examples of creational patterns include Singleton  Factory  Abstract Factory  and Builder. Structural patterns: These patterns focus on object composition  providing ways to organize and structure classes and objects to solve design problems.  Examples of structural patterns include Adapter  Bridge  Decorator  Facade  Flyweight  and Proxy. Behavioral patterns: These patterns define communication patterns between objects and classes to solve common design problems.  Examples of behavioral patterns include Chain of Responsibility  Command  Interpreter  Iterator  Mediator  Memento  Observer  State  Strategy  Template Method  and Visitor.
