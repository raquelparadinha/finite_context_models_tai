574 RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a technology that uses radio waves to wirelessly transmit data from a tag or label attached to an object to a reader.  RFID technology can be classified into two types: passive RFID and active RFID. Passive RFID tags or labels do not have their own power source and rely on the power transmitted from the RFID reader to send their information.  When the RFID reader emits a signal  the passive RFID tag or label receives the signal and uses the power to transmit its information back to the reader.  Passive RFID tags are typically used for tracking inventory  managing supply chains  and tracking assets. Active RFID tags or labels  on the other hand  have their own power source and can transmit data independently of an RFID reader.  These tags use batteries or other power sources to broadcast a signal to the reader.  Active RFID tags are often used for tracking high-value assets  such as shipping containers or vehicles  or for tracking people in environments like hospitals or warehouses. The main differences between passive and active RFID are their power requirements and the range over which they can operate.  Passive RFID tags are cheaper  smaller  and have a shorter read range than active RFID tags.  Active RFID tags are more expensive  larger  and can have a longer read range.  The choice between passive and active RFID depends on the application and the requirements of the specific use case.
