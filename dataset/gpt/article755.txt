E-waste disposal is an important environmental concern  as electronic devices can contain hazardous materials and chemicals that can pollute the environment if not disposed of properly. Recycling is the most common method of disposing of e-waste from computers.  Recycling involves separating the different components of the computer  such as metals  plastics  and glass  and processing them to make new products.  Many local and national organizations offer e-waste recycling programs  which can help ensure that e-waste is disposed of safely and responsibly.
