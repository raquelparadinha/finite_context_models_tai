847 The darknet refers to a private and encrypted network that is hidden from the public internet and is only accessible through specialized software  configurations  and authorization.  Darknets are often used to provide anonymous and untraceable communication channels for individuals or groups who want to keep their online activities private or hidden from surveillance. The most well-known darknet is the Tor network  which is a decentralized and anonymous network that allows users to browse the internet anonymously  access hidden services  and communicate privately.  However  not all darknets are used for legitimate purposes  and some are used to facilitate illegal activities such as drug trafficking  hacking  and online marketplaces for illicit goods and services. It's important to note that the term darknet is often conflated with the deep web  which refers to parts of the internet that are not indexed by search engines and are not easily accessible through standard web browsers.  While some parts of the deep web may be accessed through darknets  the two terms are not interchangeable  and not all parts of the deep web are illicit or illegal.
