729 The history of handwriting recognition systems dates back to the 1960s  when researchers began to develop algorithms to recognize handwritten characters and symbols.  One of the earliest systems was developed at IBM  which used pattern recognition techniques to recognize handwritten digits. In the following decades  researchers continued to refine handwriting recognition algorithms  and by the 1980s  commercial handwriting recognition systems began to appear.  These early systems were limited in their accuracy and were mostly used in specialized applications such as check processing. The introduction of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in the 1990s and the increasing use of tablet computers and smartphones in the 2000s led to renewed interest in handwriting recognition technology.  By the early 2000s  handwriting recognition software had become widely available on mobile devices  allowing users to input text using a stylus or their finger.
