695 LAN stands for Local Area Network  which is a computer network that connects devices within a limited area  such as a home  office  or school.  It allows for the sharing of resources  such as files and printers  and enables communication between connected devices.  LANs are typically faster and more secure than wide area networks (WANs)  which connect devices over a larger geographic area  such as the internet.
