958 Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.  They are essentially templates for solving design problems that arise during software development.  Design patterns provide a common language and framework for developers to communicate and share best practices. Design patterns were first popularized in the 1990s by a book called Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma  Richard Helm  Ralph Johnson  and John Vlissides (commonly referred to as the Gang of Four or GoF).  The book presented 23 design patterns organized into three categories: creational  structural  and behavioral. Creational patterns are used to create objects in a flexible and reusable way  while structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures.  Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities.
