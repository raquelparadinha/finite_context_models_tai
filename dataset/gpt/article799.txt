798 Fuzzy logic is a mathematical framework for dealing with uncertainty and imprecision in decision-making.  Unlike traditional logic  which deals with crisp or binary values (true or false  0 or 1)  fuzzy logic allows for values that are partially true or partially false. Fuzzy logic is based on the idea of fuzzy sets  which are sets that allow for degrees of membership.  For example  in a traditional set  an element is either a member or it is not.  But in a fuzzy set  an element can have a degree of membership between 0 and 1.  For example  the statement the temperature is hot could be assigned a degree of membership based on how hot it is.
