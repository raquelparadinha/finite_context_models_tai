814 Active Server Pages (ASP) is a server-side scripting language used for creating dynamic web pages and web applications.  It was first introduced by Microsoft in the late 1990s as a technology for building server-side web applications on Windows servers. ASP scripts are written in a scripting language such as VBScript or JScript and are embedded in HTML pages.  When a user requests an ASP page  the web server executes the ASP script on the server and generates dynamic HTML pages to be sent back to the client's browser. ASP provides a wide range of functionality for creating dynamic web pages  including database connectivity  form processing  session management  and authentication.  It can also be used with other web technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)  JavaScript  and XML. In addition to classic ASP  Microsoft also developed ASP. NET  which is a more modern web application framework that supports multiple programming languages  including C#  Visual Basic  and F#.  ASP. NET is designed to be more modular  scalable  and secure than classic ASP and provides a wide range of built-in features for creating dynamic web applications.
