981 Electronic calculators are handheld devices or software applications that are used to perform mathematical calculations  including basic arithmetic operations (addition  subtraction  multiplication  and division)  as well as more complex functions such as square roots  percentages  exponentials  logarithms  and trigonometric functions. The first electronic calculator was developed in the 1960s and was a significant improvement over mechanical calculators  which were slow and cumbersome.  Electronic calculators are much faster and more accurate than mechanical calculators  and they can perform more complex calculations. Electronic calculators typically have a numeric keypad  a display screen  and a microprocessor that performs the calculations.  They can also have memory functions that allow users to store and recall numbers or perform multiple calculations at once.
