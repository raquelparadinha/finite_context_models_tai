970 The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.  It represents the web page as a tree-like structure  with each element on the page (such as headings  paragraphs  images  and links) represented as a node in the tree. The DOM is accessed using scripting languages such as JavaScript  and provides a way for developers to manipulate the content and structure of web pages dynamically.  By using the DOM  developers can create interactive web applications that respond to user actions  update content dynamically  and provide a rich user experience.
