907 Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a security protocol that is used to establish an encrypted link between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a web server).  This encrypted link ensures that any data that is transmitted between the client and server is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.  SSL uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms to encrypt the data  and it also provides mechanisms for authenticating the server and  optionally  the client.  SSL has been succeeded by Transport Layer Security (TLS)  but the term SSL is still commonly used to refer to this type of security protocol.
