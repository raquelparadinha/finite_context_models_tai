836 A Certification Authority (CA) is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates to verify the identity of individuals  organizations  or other entities.  A digital certificate is a form of electronic identification that contains information about the identity of the certificate holder  including their public key  which can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. CAs are responsible for verifying the identity of certificate holders and issuing certificates that are trusted by other entities in the digital ecosystem.  This helps to establish secure communications between parties and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted over the internet. CAs operate under a hierarchical structure  with root CAs at the top of the hierarchy and subordinate CAs below them.  Root CAs issue certificates to subordinate CAs  which can then issue certificates to end-users.  This structure ensures that trust is maintained throughout the digital ecosystem and that certificates are only issued to trusted parties.
