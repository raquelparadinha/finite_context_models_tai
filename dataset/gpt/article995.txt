994 In computer programming  a character is a single symbol  such as a letter  number  or punctuation mark  that can be represented in a computer's memory using a binary code.  Characters are used to represent textual data  such as words and sentences  in computer programs. A string is a sequence of characters that are treated as a single unit in a computer program.  Strings are typically used to represent text data  such as names  addresses  and other types of textual information.  In many programming languages  strings are denoted by enclosing the sequence of characters within quotation marks. Strings are useful for manipulating text data in computer programs.  Common operations on strings include concatenation (combining two or more strings into a single string)  substring extraction (extracting a portion of a string)  and searching for specific characters or patterns within a string. In addition to representing plain text  strings can also be used to represent other types of data  such as binary data or encoded data.  For example  a string could be used to represent a sequence of bytes that make up an image or a sound file.
