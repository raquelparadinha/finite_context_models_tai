709 FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol  which is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between computers on the internet. FTP allows users to upload and download files from a remote server  such as a web server or a file storage service.  To use FTP  users need an FTP client program  which can connect to an FTP server using a username and password  and then transfer files using commands such as upload  download  delete  or rename. FTP is commonly used for website maintenance  software distribution  and large file transfers  and it is supported by most operating systems and web browsers.  However  FTP is not a secure protocol  and data transferred over FTP is not encrypted  which can make it vulnerable to interception or modification by unauthorized parties.  For this reason  more secure protocols such as SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP over SSL) are often used instead of plain FTP.
