811 A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in object-oriented programming.  A class defines the properties and behaviors that objects created from the class will have.  Classes are a key concept in object-oriented programming  as they provide a way to encapsulate data and logic into reusable and modular components.  A class can define data members  also known as fields or attributes  which represent the state of an object  as well as methods  which represent the behavior of an object.  Classes can also define constructors  which are special methods used to create and initialize objects of the class  and destructors  which are used to clean up resources when an object is no longer needed.  Classes can also have inheritance relationships  where one class can inherit the properties and behaviors of another class.  This allows for the creation of specialized classes that build upon the properties and behaviors of more general classes. In summary  a class is a blueprint for creating objects  encapsulating both data and behavior into a reusable component  and providing the foundation for the object-oriented programming paradigm.
