837 In computer science  a checksum is a value calculated from a set of data  typically a file or a message  used to detect errors that may have occurred during transmission or storage. The checksum is usually a small fixed-size value that is generated using an algorithm  such as the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithm.  The algorithm takes the data as input and produces a unique checksum value that is different for each set of data. Checksums are commonly used to verify the integrity of data during transmission or storage.  When a file is transmitted over a network or stored on a disk  its checksum is calculated and transmitted or stored alongside the file.  When the file is received or accessed  the checksum is recalculated and compared to the original checksum.  If the two checksums match  it is assumed that the data has not been corrupted or modified during transmission or storage. Checksums can also be used to detect accidental or intentional changes to data.  If even a single bit of the data is changed  the checksum value will be different  indicating that an error has occurred.  Checksums can be used to detect errors in a wide range of applications  including network protocols  file systems  and databases.
