614 Software development generally follows a standard process  which can be summarized in the following steps:Requirements Gathering: This is the initial stage of software development  where the requirements for the software are collected from stakeholders  users  and business analysts. Analysis and Design: The gathered requirements are analyzed and the system architecture is designed.  The design is documented in the form of diagrams  flowcharts  or other models. Implementation: The software is developed based on the design using a programming language and development tools. Testing: Once the software is developed  it is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as intended.  Testing may include unit testing  integration testing  and system testing. Deployment: After testing  the software is deployed to the production environment or to the end-users. Maintenance: After the software is deployed  it may require maintenance to fix any bugs or issues that are discovered  as well as to add new features or enhancements. These steps may be iterative  with the development team going back and forth between steps as necessary to refine the software and ensure that it meets the needs of the users and stakeholders.
