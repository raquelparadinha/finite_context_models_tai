931 Error handling refers to the process of detecting  reporting  and resolving errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a computer program or system.  Errors can occur due to a variety of reasons  such as incorrect input  hardware malfunctions  or programming errors. When an error occurs  the program or system must be able to identify the error and take appropriate action to resolve it.  This may involve notifying the user of the error  logging the error for later analysis  or attempting to recover from the error by executing an alternative path or retrying the operation. There are several techniques for error handling in computing  including:Exception handling: This involves using try-catch statements or other constructs to identify and handle exceptions in a program. Error codes: This involves using predefined error codes to identify specific types of errors and taking appropriate action based on the error code. Error messages: This involves providing descriptive error messages to users to help them understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Logging: This involves recording error information in logs for later analysis and troubleshooting.
