879 Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP)  which is the communications protocol used to send and receive data over the internet.  IPv6 was developed to address the limitations of the previous version  IPv4  which was designed in the 1980s and has since run out of available IP addresses. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address format  compared to the 32-bit format used by IPv4  allowing for a significantly larger number of available IP addresses.  This is important as the growth of the internet and the number of devices connected to it has increased dramatically in recent years.  IPv6 also includes additional features  such as improved security and network auto-configuration. Although IPv6 has been available for many years  the adoption has been relatively slow.  This is due to several factors  including the complexity of transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 and the fact that IPv4 is still widely used and supported.  However  as the demand for IP addresses continues to increase  the transition to IPv6 is becoming more necessary  and many organizations and internet service providers are gradually making the switch.
