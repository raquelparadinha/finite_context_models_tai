809 An applet is a small  lightweight Java program that is intended to be run within a web browser.  Applets are embedded in HTML pages and can be executed within a web browser's Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  They are often used to provide interactive and dynamic content  such as animations  games  and other graphical user interface (GUI) elements.  The applets are typically written in Java  a programming language that is known for its platform independence  meaning that the same Java applet can run on different operating systems and devices.  This makes applets ideal for creating web-based applications that can be accessed from any device with a web browser and a JVM.  Applets are usually restricted in terms of the resources they can access and the actions they can perform  for security reasons.  This helps prevent malicious applets from accessing sensitive information on the user's computer or from performing harmful actions.  Applets have been largely replaced by alternative technologies such as JavaServer Pages (JSP)  JavaServer Faces (JSF)  and JavaScript  which offer greater flexibility and better performance for web-based applications.  However  applets are still used in some areas  such as scientific simulations  educational games  and other specialized applications.
