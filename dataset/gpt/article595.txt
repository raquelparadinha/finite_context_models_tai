594 There are several trends in recent years that have changed the emphasis in scheduling algorithms.  Two of the most significant trends are:Multi-core and many-core processors: Modern computer systems often have multiple cores  which means that there are several processors on a single chip.  This trend has led to an increased emphasis on parallel processing and scheduling algorithms that can take advantage of the parallelism offered by multiple cores. Cloud computing: Cloud computing has become increasingly popular  and it allows users to access computing resources on demand.  This trend has led to an increased emphasis on scheduling algorithms that can handle dynamic workloads  where the number of users and the demand for computing resources can vary over time. As a result of these trends  scheduling algorithms have evolved to become more complex and sophisticated.  Many modern scheduling algorithms are designed to take advantage of parallel processing and dynamic workloads  while still ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.  Some examples of these algorithms include gang scheduling  space-sharing scheduling  and adaptive scheduling.
