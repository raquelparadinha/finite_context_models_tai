935 Data abstraction is a programming concept that allows complex data to be represented in a simplified way  by hiding the implementation details of data and only showing the essential features to the user.  It is a technique of breaking down a complex system into simpler  more manageable components  which makes it easier to design  develop  and maintain software systems. In data abstraction  the user interacts with a simplified interface that exposes only the relevant properties or behaviors of the data  while hiding the underlying implementation details.  This allows the user to focus on the essential aspects of the data without being burdened by unnecessary complexity.
