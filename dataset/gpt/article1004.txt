1003 In object-oriented programming (OOP)  a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.  It defines a set of properties (also known as attributes or fields) and methods that are common to all objects of a certain type. A class provides a way to encapsulate data and functionality  allowing for modular and organized programming.  It defines the behavior and properties of a certain type of object  but does not create any actual objects itself.  Instead  an object is created from a class using a process called instantiation. A class can be thought of as a template or a cookie cutter  while an object is an instance of that template or cookie cutter.  For example  a class called Person might define attributes such as name  age  and address  and methods such as walk and speak.  An object created from the Person class would have specific values for those attributes (such as John  30  and 123 Main St. )  and would be able to perform the methods defined in the class. Classes can also inherit properties and methods from other classes  allowing for more complex relationships and structures.  This is known as inheritance and is a key feature of OOP.
