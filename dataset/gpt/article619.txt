618 Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through an array of elements and compares adjacent elements  swapping them if they are in the wrong order.  The algorithm continues to iterate through the array until no more swaps are necessary  indicating that the array is sorted. In each step of the algorithm  the current element is compared with the next element and swapped if they are in the wrong order.  The algorithm continues to iterate through the array until no more swaps are necessary  indicating that the array is sorted. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2)  which makes it inefficient for large arrays.  However  it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or as a building block for more complex sorting algorithms.
