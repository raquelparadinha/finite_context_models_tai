900 Remote Access Tools (RATs) are software tools that allow users to remotely access and control another computer or device over a network connection.  RATs can be used for a variety of legitimate purposes  such as IT support  remote working  and online collaboration. However  RATs can also be used maliciously  such as in the case of cyber attacks or unauthorized surveillance.  Hackers can use RATs to gain unauthorized access to a victim's computer or network  allowing them to steal sensitive data  install malware  or carry out other nefarious activities. RATs can be disguised as legitimate software  making them difficult to detect and remove.  To protect against RATs  it is important to use reputable antivirus and firewall software  keep software up to date with the latest security patches  and be cautious when downloading or installing software from untrusted sources.
