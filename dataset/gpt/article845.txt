844 Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) refers to the information and communication technology (ICT) systems and networks that are vital to the functioning of a society or an economy. CII includes various types of infrastructure  such as telecommunication networks  financial systems  transportation systems  energy grids  and government databases  that are essential for providing services and enabling economic activity. Because CII is essential for the functioning of society  it is also a potential target for cyber attacks or other forms of disruption.  Protecting CII is therefore critical for ensuring the resilience and continuity of essential services  as well as protecting national security. Many countries have established policies and regulations for protecting CII  including implementing specific security measures  conducting risk assessments  and establishing incident response plans.  In some cases  government agencies may also collaborate with private sector organizations that operate CII to coordinate security efforts and share information about potential threats or vulnerabilities.
