866 Burden of proof refers to the responsibility of a party in a legal proceeding to provide evidence to support their claim or defense.  In a criminal case  the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt  while in a civil case  the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence.  The concept ensures that legal decisions are based on evidence rather than speculation and helps prevent unjust decisions.
