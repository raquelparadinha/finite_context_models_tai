682 The journey of the word processor can be traced back to the mid-1960s  when IBM developed the Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter (MT/ST).  This was the first commercially available word processing machine  and it used magnetic tape to store and edit text. In the 1970s  the first true word processors were developed.  These machines  such as the Wang 1200 and the Xerox Alto  used digital technology to store and edit text.  The Wang 1200 was one of the first word processors to feature a CRT display  which allowed users to see what they were typing as they typed it. By the 1980s  personal computers had become more powerful and affordable  and word processing software began to be developed for these machines.  Some of the early popular word processing software included WordStar  WordPerfect  and Microsoft Word. In the 1990s and early 2000s  word processing software became more advanced  with features such as spell-checking  grammar-checking  and desktop publishing tools.  The rise of the internet and email also led to the development of collaborative word processing software such as Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365. Today  word processors continue to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of users.  The software has become more user-friendly  with intuitive interfaces and features that make it easier to create and edit documents.  Word processors are now available as both standalone software applications and cloud-based services  allowing users to access their documents from anywhere and collaborate in real-time with others.
