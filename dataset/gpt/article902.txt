901 The Rijndael algorithm is a symmetric key block cipher algorithm used for encryption and decryption of digital data.  It was selected as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 2001  replacing the Data Encryption Standard (DES). The Rijndael algorithm operates on fixed block sizes of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128  192  or 256 bits.  It uses a series of mathematical operations  including substitution  permutation  and XOR operations  to transform plaintext into ciphertext. The Rijndael algorithm is considered secure and widely used in many applications  including secure communication protocols  digital rights management  and data storage encryption.  It is also used in many popular software applications  including Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Office.
