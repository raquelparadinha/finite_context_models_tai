723 In computer science  a hash is a fixed-length string of characters generated by applying a mathematical function or algorithm to a variable-length input data.  The resulting hash value is usually a unique representation of the input data  which is why it is commonly used for data integrity  authentication  and encryption. Hashing is a widely used technique for data storage  indexing  and retrieval.  Hash functions are designed to map variable-length data to a fixed-size hash value in a way that is fast  efficient  and avoids collisions.
