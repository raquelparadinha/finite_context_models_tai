937 Data acquisition (DAQ) is the process of acquiring or collecting data from various sources  such as sensors  instruments  and other devices  in order to analyze  monitor  or control a system or process.  The data acquisition process typically involves the conversion of analog signals from sensors or devices into digital signals that can be processed by a computer or other digital device. In practical terms  data acquisition involves connecting sensors or instruments to a computer or other digital device using a data acquisition system  which may include hardware components such as amplifiers  filters  and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)  as well as software applications or programming languages for controlling and processing the data.
