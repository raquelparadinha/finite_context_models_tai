1014 Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a specific event will occur.  It is a mathematical concept that is used to describe the uncertainty or randomness of an event.  Probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1  where 0 represents an impossible event and 1 represents a certain event. The probability of an event occurring can be calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.  For example  if a coin is flipped  the probability of getting heads is 1/2 or 0. 5  since there are two possible outcomes (heads or tails) and one of them is favorable. Probability theory is used in a wide range of fields  including statistics  economics  physics  engineering  and computer science.  It is used to model and analyze complex systems that involve randomness or uncertainty  such as weather patterns  stock prices  and game theory.
