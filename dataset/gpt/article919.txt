918 Electronic voting systems can be classified into three main categories:Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Systems: In this type of system  voters directly cast their votes using an electronic interface  such as a touchscreen or button.  The votes are stored on a memory device  typically a digital card or hard drive  and can be tallied automatically. Optical Scan Systems: In this type of system  voters mark their choices on a paper ballot  which is then scanned and tallied electronically.  The system reads the marks on the ballot  such as circles or checkboxes  using optical character recognition (OCR) or image scanning technology. Remote Electronic Voting Systems: This type of system allows voters to cast their ballots from a remote location using a computer or mobile device.  This type of system may use encryption and other security measures to ensure that the votes are secure and confidential.
