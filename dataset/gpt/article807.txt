806 The history of basic programming languages dates back to the mid-1960s.  Early computer programming languages were designed to be easy to use and understand  making them accessible to a wider range of people.  The first basic programming language was FORTRAN (Formula Translation)  which was developed in the mid-1950s and used primarily for scientific and engineering applications.  In 1964  John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz at Dartmouth College created BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)  which was designed to be easy to learn and use for beginners.  BASIC was widely adopted and became popular among hobbyist and amateur computer users.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s  other basic programming languages were developed  including COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language)  used for business applications  and Pascal  used for teaching programming concepts.  These languages set the foundation for modern programming and helped make programming more accessible and user-friendly.  Over the years  basic programming languages have evolved to include more advanced features  making them suitable for a wider range of applications  but their simplicity and accessibility continue to be their defining characteristics.
