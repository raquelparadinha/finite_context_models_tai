943 Data accessibility refers to the ease with which data can be accessed and used by authorized individuals or systems.  It is a critical aspect of data management  as it enables organizations to leverage their data assets to support business objectives. Data accessibility can be influenced by several factors  including:Data storage: The location and format of data can affect its accessibility.  Data that is stored in a centralized location  in a standardized format  and with clear data definitions is typically more accessible than data that is dispersed across multiple locations or in varied formats. Data security: Access controls and other security measures can affect data accessibility.  Data that is highly secure may be more difficult to access  while data that is less secure may be more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Data governance: Clear data governance policies and procedures can help to ensure that data is accessible to those who need it.  This can include establishing clear data ownership  developing data management processes  and ensuring that data is properly classified and labeled. Data integration: Integrating data from multiple sources into a single  unified view can increase data accessibility.  This can include developing data integration processes  establishing data integration standards  and using data integration tools.
