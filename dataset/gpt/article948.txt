947 Data compression is the process of reducing the amount of space required to store or transmit digital data by removing redundant or non-essential information from the data.  This is achieved by encoding the data using an algorithm that can be used to recreate the original data accurately. Data compression is used to save storage space  reduce the amount of time required to transmit data over a network  and reduce the cost of data storage and transmission.  The effectiveness of data compression depends on the type of data being compressed  as well as the compression algorithm used.
