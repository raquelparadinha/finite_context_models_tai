680 A wiki is a collaborative website that allows users to create  edit  and link web pages easily.  The structure of a wiki typically consists of the following elements:Pages: A wiki is made up of individual pages  each of which can contain text  images  links  and other media.  Pages can be created  edited  and deleted by users with appropriate permissions. Links: Pages in a wiki are connected through links  which allow users to navigate from one page to another.  Links can be created within a page or between pages  and they often form a web of interconnected information. Navigation: A wiki typically has a navigation system that allows users to browse through pages and find the information they need.  Navigation can take the form of a table of contents  a search bar  or a hierarchical menu. History: One of the defining features of a wiki is its revision history.  Every change made to a page is recorded  allowing users to see who made what changes and when.  This makes it easy to track the evolution of a page over time and to undo mistakes or vandalism. Categories: Categories are a way of organizing pages in a wiki.  Pages can be assigned to one or more categories  which helps users find related content and facilitates maintenance and cleanup of the wiki. Overall  the structure of a wiki is designed to promote collaboration and sharing of knowledge among a community of users.  By allowing anyone to contribute and edit pages  wikis can quickly accumulate a wealth of information and evolve over time to reflect the collective knowledge of their users.
