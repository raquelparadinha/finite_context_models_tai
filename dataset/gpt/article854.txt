853 A Digital Signature is a cryptographic technique used to authenticate the integrity and origin of a digital message or document in computer security.  It provides assurance that the message or document has not been altered in transit and that it was signed by the intended signer. Digital signatures are based on a mathematical algorithm that creates a unique digital fingerprint of the message or document  called a hash.  The hash is then encrypted using the signer's private key  which is known only to the signer  to create a digital signature.  The recipient of the message or document can then verify the signature using the signer's public key  which can be obtained from a trusted third party  such as a Certificate Authority. The process of verifying a digital signature involves recreating the hash of the original message or document and comparing it to the decrypted digital signature.  If the two hashes match  then the signature is considered valid and the recipient can be confident that the message or document has not been tampered with and was signed by the intended signer. Digital signatures are used in a variety of applications  including email  software distribution  and online transactions.  They provide a secure way to authenticate the identity of the signer and ensure the integrity of the signed message or document.
