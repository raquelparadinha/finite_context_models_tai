1012 CMYK stands for Cyan  Magenta  Yellow  and Key (Black)  which are the primary colors used in printing.  In the CMYK color model  colors are created by combining different intensities of cyan  magenta  yellow  and black ink. The CMYK color model is based on the subtractive color theory  which states that by subtracting different colors from white  all colors can be created.  When all four colors are combined at their full intensity  they absorb all the light and produce black. In the CMYK color model  each color component is typically represented as a percentage value ranging from 0% to 100%  where 0% indicates no ink and 100% indicates full ink coverage.  By combining different percentages of cyan  magenta  yellow  and black  a wide range of colors can be created.
