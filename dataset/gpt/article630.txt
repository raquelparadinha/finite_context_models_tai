629 Sun Microsystems was a technology company that was founded in 1982 and specialized in developing computer hardware  software  and network solutions.  The company's products included workstations  servers  storage systems  and software  and it was particularly known for its Unix-based operating system  Solaris. In addition to its hardware and software products  Sun Microsystems was also a pioneer in network computing and was a major contributor to the development of the Java programming language.  Java is an object-oriented language that is designed to be platform-independent  meaning that it can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010  and many of its products and technologies have since been integrated into Oracle's offerings.  However  Sun Microsystems' legacy lives on  particularly in the continued use of Java and Solaris in various industries  including finance  telecommunications  and healthcare.
