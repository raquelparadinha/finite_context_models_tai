896 Port scanning is a technique used to discover open ports and services on a computer or network device.  A port is a communication endpoint in a network device  and each service or application running on the device typically uses a specific port to communicate with other devices on the network. Port scanning works by sending a series of network packets to a target device  each packet attempting to establish a connection on a different port.  If a connection is successful  the scanner can determine the port status (open  closed  or filtered) and potentially identify the service or application running on the port. Port scanning can be used for legitimate purposes  such as network management and security testing  but it can also be used for malicious activities  such as identifying vulnerable services or attempting to gain unauthorized access to a network. Network administrators and security professionals often use port scanning tools to identify open ports and services on their own networks  and to detect and prevent port scanning attempts by unauthorized users.
