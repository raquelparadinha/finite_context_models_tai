681 Wireless LAN  or WLAN  is a type of wireless network that uses radio waves to provide wireless high-speed internet and network connections between devices within a limited area such as a home  office  or campus. The working of wireless LAN involves the following steps:Wireless Access Point (WAP) - A WAP is a device that connects wireless devices to a wired network using radio signals.  It serves as a central hub for wireless communication between devices within the network. Wireless Network Interface Cards (NICs) - Wireless NICs are installed in devices such as laptops  smartphones  and tablets to allow them to connect to the wireless network. Radio Waves - Radio waves are used to transmit data between the WAP and the wireless NICs.  The WAP broadcasts radio signals  which are received by the wireless NICs within its range. Network Protocols - WLANs use various network protocols such as the 802. 11 standards to ensure that data is transmitted securely and efficiently between devices. Authentication and Encryption - WLANs use authentication and encryption techniques to protect the network from unauthorized access and data theft.  These techniques include WPA and WPA2 encryption  MAC filtering  and SSID hiding. Range Extenders - In case the range of the WAP is limited  range extenders can be used to increase the range of the wireless network.  Range extenders work by amplifying the radio signals and rebroadcasting them to increase the coverage area. Overall  wireless LANs provide users with the convenience and flexibility of wireless communication while maintaining the security and reliability of wired networks.
