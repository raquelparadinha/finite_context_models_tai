711 WAIS (Wide Area Information Server) was an early internet-based information retrieval system  which allowed users to search for and retrieve text-based information from a large collection of servers around the world. WAIS worked by indexing the contents of documents on participating servers and creating a searchable database of the indexed content.  Users could then search for specific keywords or phrases and retrieve a list of documents that matched their query. WAIS was widely used in the early days of the internet  before the World Wide Web became popular  and it was known for its powerful search capabilities and ability to handle large volumes of text-based data.  However  with the rise of the web and more user-friendly search interfaces  WAIS became less popular and was eventually largely supplanted by web search engines such as Google.
