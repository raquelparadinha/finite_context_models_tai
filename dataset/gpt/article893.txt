892 Ubiquitous computing  also known as pervasive computing  is a concept in computer science in which computing and communication technologies are seamlessly integrated into everyday objects and environments  allowing for constant and pervasive access to information and communication. The goal of ubiquitous computing is to create a world where technology is so seamlessly integrated into our surroundings that it becomes invisible and ubiquitous.  This can be achieved through the use of sensors  wireless communication  and the internet of things (IoT)  which allows objects to communicate with each other and with the internet. Examples of ubiquitous computing include smart homes  wearables  and smart cities  where objects and systems are interconnected and can communicate with each other to provide personalized and context-aware services. Overall  ubiquitous computing aims to create a world where technology is seamlessly integrated into our everyday lives  enhancing our experiences and making our environments more efficient  convenient  and personalized.
