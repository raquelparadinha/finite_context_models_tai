819 ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard used to represent text in computers and other devices.  It was developed in the 1960s and has been widely used in computer systems and communication protocols ever since. ASCII defines a set of 128 characters  including letters  numbers  punctuation marks  and control characters  each of which is represented by a unique 7-bit binary code.  The ASCII character set includes uppercase and lowercase letters  digits  basic punctuation  and various control characters such as carriage return and line feed. ASCII is a widely used standard and is supported by virtually all modern computer systems.  It is used in various applications  such as email  text files  and programming languages.  However  because it only includes 128 characters  it has limitations in representing non-Latin languages and complex symbols  which led to the development of other character encoding standards like Unicode. Despite the limitations  ASCII remains an important standard in computing and is still used extensively in certain applications  such as programming and data communication  where it provides a simple and reliable means of representing text.
