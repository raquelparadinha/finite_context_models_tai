721 In computer science  a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that is used to efficiently maintain a collection of elements where the priority of each element is determined by its value or some other key. Heaps can be of two types:Max heap: In a max heap  the parent nodes are always greater than or equal to their child nodes.  The maximum element in the heap is always the root node. Min heap: In a min heap  the parent nodes are always smaller than or equal to their child nodes.  The minimum element in the heap is always the root node. A heap is often used in algorithms such as sorting  graph algorithms  and priority queue implementations. The most common operation performed on a heap is insertion  where a new element is added to the heap in a way that maintains the heap property.  The next most common operation is deletion  where the root node is removed from the heap and replaced with another element in a way that also maintains the heap property.  Other common operations on a heap include searching for an element  merging two heaps  and extracting the maximum or minimum element. Heaps have an average time complexity of O(log n) for both insertion and deletion  making them a popular choice for a wide range of applications where efficient and fast access to elements is required.
