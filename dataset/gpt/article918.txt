917 Eiffel has been implemented and used in a variety of settings  including commercial applications  academic research  and open source software development.  Here are some examples of Eiffel implementations and uses:Commercial applications: Eiffel has been used to develop commercial software applications in fields such as finance  healthcare  and aerospace.  For example  the Eiffel-based language technology company Eiffel Software has developed software for financial institutions  medical device manufacturers  and other industries. Academic research: Eiffel has been used in academic research to explore formal methods  software engineering principles  and programming language design.  For example  researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign used Eiffel to develop a runtime verification tool for software testing. Open source software: Eiffel has been used in a number of open source software projects  including the EiffelStudio development environment and the SmartEiffel compiler.  These projects have made Eiffel accessible to a wider audience and helped to promote the language's adoption. Safety-critical systems: Eiffel has been used to develop software for safety-critical systems  such as aircraft control systems and medical devices.  The language's support for formal methods and design-by-contract principles make it well-suited for developing high-assurance software systems. Overall  Eiffel's strengths in software engineering  formal methods  and high-assurance systems make it a valuable tool for a range of applications and settings.
