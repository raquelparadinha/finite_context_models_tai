720 The hexadecimal system is a number system with a base of 16.  It is commonly used in computing and digital electronics  as it provides an efficient way to represent binary data.  In the hexadecimal system  each digit can have 16 different values  ranging from 0 to 9 and A to F. The first 10 digits in the hexadecimal system represent the numbers 0 to 9  while the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15.  For example  the number 10 in hexadecimal is represented by the letter A  and the number 15 is represented by the letter F. To convert a hexadecimal number to a decimal number  each digit is multiplied by its corresponding power of 16 and then added together.  For example  the hexadecimal number 3B can be converted to decimal as follows:3B = (3 x 16^1) + (11 x 16^0)= (3 x 16) + (11 x 1)= 48 + 11= 59Similarly  to convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number  the number is divided by 16 and the remainder is converted to a hexadecimal digit.  The process is repeated until the quotient becomes zero.  The resulting hexadecimal digits are written in reverse order to obtain the final hexadecimal number. For example  to convert the decimal number 210 to hexadecimal:210 Ã· 16 = 13 with a remainder of 213 Ã· 16 = 0 with a remainder of 13 (which is represented by the letter D)Therefore  210 in hexadecimal is D2.
