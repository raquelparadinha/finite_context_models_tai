830 A Bulletin Board System (BBS) is a computer system that allows users to communicate with each other and share information through a text-based interface. BBSes were popular in the 1980s and 1990s before the widespread adoption of the internet.  Users could dial into the system using a modem and interact with other users through message boards  chat rooms  and file sharing. BBSes were often run by individuals or small groups of enthusiasts and were tailored to specific communities  such as hobbyists  gamers  or hackers.  They offered a platform for users to share their interests  knowledge  and experiences  and were often characterized by a sense of community and camaraderie. Today  BBSes are less common  but some still exist as a niche hobby or retro computing project.  They have been largely replaced by online forums  social media  and other web-based communication platforms.
