It is a software system that helps users to analyze complex business problems and identify solutions based on data analysis  modeling  and visualization. A DSS typically consists of three main components: a database or data warehouse that stores relevant data  a user interface that allows users to interact with the system and provide input  and a set of analytical tools and models that help users to analyze the data and make decisions. DSSs can be used in a wide range of applications  such as financial planning  inventory management  supply chain optimization  and marketing analysis.
