848 The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that was widely used to protect data confidentiality in electronic communication and storage systems in the 1970s and 1980s. The DES algorithm works by using a single secret key to encrypt and decrypt data.  The key is used to perform a series of mathematical operations on the plaintext to produce the ciphertext  and the same key is used to reverse the operations and recover the plaintext from the ciphertext.  The key size for DES is 56 bits  and the algorithm uses a block cipher with a fixed block size of 64 bits. Although DES was considered a secure encryption standard for many years  advances in computing power and cryptographic attacks eventually rendered the algorithm vulnerable to brute-force attacks.  As a result  the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was adopted as a replacement for DES in the early 2000s.  Despite its obsolescence  DES still remains in use in some legacy systems and applications.
