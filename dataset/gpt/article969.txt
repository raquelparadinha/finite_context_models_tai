968 Distributed computing has a wide range of applications across many different fields  including science  engineering  finance  and entertainment.  Some of the key applications of distributed computing include:Scientific research: Distributed computing is widely used in scientific research to perform large-scale simulations  model complex physical systems  and analyze massive amounts of data.  Projects such as SETI@home and Folding@home use distributed computing to analyze signals from outer space and simulate protein folding  respectively. Big data analytics: Distributed computing is also used in big data analytics to process and analyze large volumes of data.  Distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark allow for the distributed processing of large datasets across multiple computers. Cloud computing: Cloud computing is a form of distributed computing that allows for on-demand access to computing resources over a network.  Cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure provide users with access to vast computing resources that can be used for a wide range of applications. Content delivery: Distributed computing is used in content delivery networks (CDNs) to deliver content such as web pages  videos  and images to users around the world.  CDNs distribute content across multiple servers located in different geographic locations  reducing latency and improving performance.
