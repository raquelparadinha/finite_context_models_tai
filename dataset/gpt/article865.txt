864 Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that is used for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML uses tags to define elements and attributes that can be used to structure and describe data in a hierarchical manner.  This makes XML a flexible and versatile language that can be used to represent a wide variety of data types and document structures. XML is widely used in web development  database management  and other areas where structured data needs to be exchanged between different systems and platforms.  XML documents can be validated using a Document Type Definition (DTD) or an XML Schema  which ensures that the document conforms to a specific set of rules and guidelines. One of the main advantages of XML is its platform independence.  XML documents can be created and processed on any platform or operating system  which makes it an ideal choice for data exchange and integration in heterogeneous computing environments. Overall  XML is a powerful tool for structuring and describing data  and it is widely used in many different industries and applications.
