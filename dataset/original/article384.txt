383 Ubiquitous Computing is a term put forward by Mark Weiser in Ubiquitous Computing is a term put forward by Mark Weiser in 1988â€š describing it as information technologyâ€™s next wave after the mainframe and PC.  In this new worldâ€š what Weiser called â€œcalm technologyâ€ will reside around usâ€š interacting with users in natural ways to anticipate their needs and supply the information they want wherever they are.  Pervasive Computing requires that computing devices are ubiquitious and if not invisibleâ€š at least handy for users and easy to take wherever one wishes to go (e. g. â€š small cellular used for tracking location of person).  PervasiveComputing envisions environments richly lathered with computationâ€š communication and networked devicesâ€š mobile users interacting with their environment using speech and visionâ€š with secure access to personal or publicdata.  Pervasive Computing environments will not simply be standalone vehicles for number crunchingâ€š rather they will immerse their users in a triad of nvisible computationâ€š communication and devicesâ€š working in concert to satisfy userrequirements according to the facilities available in the environment. As such Pervasive Computing is a world saturated with computing andcommunication on the road to Ubiquitous Computing.  The latter also gracefully integrates social and end-user issues including but not limited to SocialInformatics and Social Securematics.
