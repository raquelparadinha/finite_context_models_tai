199    Netnews  (also  called  Usenet   for  UNIx  User  Net-work)  is  in  effect  the  worldâ€™s  largest  computer  bul-letin  board.   It  began  in  1979   when  Duke  University and the University of North Carolina set up a simple mechanism for â€œpostingâ€ text files that could be read by  other  users.   Today  there  are  tens  of  thousands  of topical â€œnewsgroupsâ€ and millions of messages (called articles).   Although  still  impressive  in  its  quantity  of content   many  Web  users  now  rely  more  on  discus-sion  forums  based  on  Web  pages   .
