3 These suggestions include:  Learn about the purpose of a newsgroup before you post to it.  If a group is moderated  understand the moderatorâ€™s guidelines so your postings wonâ€™t be rejected.   Before posting  follow some discussions to see what sort of language  tone  and attitude seems to be appropriate for this group Do not post bulky graphics or other attachments unless the group is designed for them.   Avoid â€œad hominemâ€ (to the person) attacks when discussing disagreements.   Do not post in ALL CAPS  which is interpreted as â€œshouting. â€  Check your postings for proper spelling and grammar.  On the other hand  avoid â€œflamingâ€ other users for their spelling or grammar errors.   When replying to an existing message  include enough of the original message to provide context for your reply  but no more.   If you know the answer to a question or problem raised by another user  send it to that user by e-mail.  That way the newsgroup doesnâ€™t get cluttered up with dozens of versions of the same information.
