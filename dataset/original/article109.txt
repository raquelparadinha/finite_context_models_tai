108 The simplest and least efficient kind of sort is called the selection sort.  Rather like a bridge player organizing a hand  the selection sort involves finding the record with the lowest key and swapping it with the first record  then scanning back through for the next lowest key and swapping it with the second record  and so on until all the records are sorted.  While this uses memory very efficiently (since the records are sorted in place)  it is not only slow  but also gets worse fast.  That is  the time taken to sort n records is proportional to n2. The selection approach suffers because on each pass the sort determines not only the record with the lowest key but 446? ? ? ? sorting and searchingthe one with the next lowest key.  However  that information is not retained.  The heapsort  invented by John Williams in 1964  uses a binary tree to store a heap of sorted records  .  Once the heap is built  the tree nodes can be used to store record numbers in a corresponding array that will represent the sorted database.  The heapsort is efficient because no records are physically moved  and the only memory needed is for the heap and array.  The heapsort is generally considered the fastest and most reliable general-purpose sorting algorithm  with a maximum running time of log n
