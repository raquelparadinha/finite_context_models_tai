147 A binary tree is a tree in which no node has more than two child nodes.  To move through data stored in a binary tree  a program can use two pointers  one to the current nodeâ€™s left child and one to its right child  .  The pointers can then be used to trace the paths through the nodes.  If the tree represents a file that has been sorted    comparing nodes to the desired value and branching accordingly quickly leads to the desired record. Alternatively  the data can be stored directly in contiguous memory locations corresponding to the successive numbers of the nodes.  This method is faster than having to trace through successive pointers  and a binary search algorithm can be applied directly to the stored data.  On the other hand it is easier to insert new items into a linked list  . A common solution is to combine the two structures  storing the linked list in a contiguous range of memory by storing its root in the middle of the range  its left child at the beginning of the range  its right child at the end  and then repeatedly splitting each portion of the range to store each level of children.  Intuitively  one can see that algorithms for processing such stored trees will take a recursive approach
