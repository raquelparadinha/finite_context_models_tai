146 The tree is a data structure that consists of individual intersections called nodes.  The tree normally starts with a single root node.  (Unlike real trees  data trees have their root at the top and branch downward. ) The root connects to one or more nodes  which in turn branch into additional nodes  often through a number of levels.  (A node that branches downward from another node is called that nodeâ€™s childnode. ) A node at the bottom that does not branch any further is called a terminal node or sometimes a leaf. Trees are useful for expressing many sorts of hierarchical structures such as file systems where the root of a disk holds folders that in turn can hold files or additional folders  and so on down many levels.  (A corporate organization chart is a noncomputer example of a hierarchical tree. )
