443 The data structures commonly used in computer science include arrays (as discussed above) and various types of lists.  The primary difference between an array and a list is that an array has no internal links between its elements  data structures? ? ? ? 137while a list has one or more pointers that link the elements.  There are several types of specialized list.  A tree is a list that has a root (an element with no predecessor)  and each other element has a unique predecessor.  The guarantee of a unique path to each tree node can make the operations of inserting or deleting an item faster.  A stack is a list that is accessible only at the top (or front).  Any new item is inserted (â€œpushedâ€) on top of the last item  and removing (â€œpoppingâ€) an item always removes the item that was last inserted.  This order of access is called LIFO (last in  first out).  A list can also be organized in a first in  first out (FIFO) order.  This type of list is called a queue  and is useful in a situation where tasks must â€œwait their turnâ€ for attention
