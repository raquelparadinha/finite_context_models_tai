504 Although most color schemes now support thousands or millions of colors  it would be wasteful and inefficient to use three or four bytes to store the color of each pixel in memory.  After all  any given application is likely to need only a few dozen colors.  The solution is to set up a palette which is a table of (usually 256) color values currently in use by the program.  (A palette is also sometimes called a CLUT  or color lookup table. ) The color of each pixel can then be stored as an index to the corresponding value in the palette
