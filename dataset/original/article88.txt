87 Even if scientists have a basic understanding of a system  it may be hard to determine what the overall results of the interaction of the many particles (or other elements) in the system will be.  This is true  for example  in the analysis of events taking place in nuclear reactors.  Fortunately computers can apply the laws of the system to each of many particles and determine the resulting actions from their aggregate behavior  .  Simulation is particularly important in fields where actual experiments are not possible because of distance or time.  Thus  a hypothesis about the formation of the universe can be tested by applying it to a set of initial conditions believed to reflect those at or near the time of the big bang. However  even the most skilled scientists have trouble relating numbers to the shape and interaction of real-world objects.  Computers have greatly aided in making it possible to visualize structures and phenomena using high-resolution 3D color graphics  .  Features of interest can be enhanced  and arbitrary (â€œfalseâ€) colors can be used to visually show such things as temperature or blood flow.  These techniques can also be used to create interactive models where scientists can  for example  combine molecules in new ways and have the computer calculate the likely properties of the result.  Finally  computer visualization and modeling can be used both to teach science and to give the general public some visceral grasp of the meaning of scientific theories and discoveries
