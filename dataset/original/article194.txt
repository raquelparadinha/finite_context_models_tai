193 Java  has  largely  fulfilled  this  promise  for  Web  developers.  C++  programmers  have  an  easy  learning  curve  to  Java  since  the  two  languages  have  very  similar  syntax  and  a similar use of classes and other object-oriented features.  On the  other  hand   programmers  who  donâ€™t  know  C++  benefit from  Java  being  more  streamlined  than  C++.   For  example  Java avoids the necessity to use pointers    and  uses  classes  as  the  consistent  building block of program structure.  Software powerhouses such as microsoft (until recently) and IBm have joined Sun in pro-moting Java. Another  much-touted  feature  of  Java  is  its  platform independence.  The language itself is separate from the vari-ous  operating  system  platforms.   For  each  platform   a  Java Vir tual machine ( JVm) is created  which interprets or com-piles the code generated by the Java compiler so it can run on that platform. For  security   Java  applets  run  within  a  â€œsandboxâ€  or restricted  environment  so  the  user  is  protected  from  mali-cious   Java   programs.    (For   example    programs   are   not allowed  to  access  the  userâ€™s  disk  or  to  connect  the  userâ€™s machine to another Web site. ) Web browsers can also be set to disable the running of Java applets.
