220 A  handwriting  recognition  system  begins  by  building a representation of the userâ€™s writing.  With a pen or stylus system  this representation is not simply a graphical image but  includes  the  recorded  â€œstrokesâ€  or  discrete  movements that  make  up  the  letters.   The  software  must  then  create  a representation  of  features  of  the  handwriting  that  can  be used  to  match  it  to  the  appropriate  character  templates.  Handwriting  recognition  is  actually  an  application  of  the larger problem of identifying the significance of features in a pattern.
