268 There are many calculations or other processes that can be described using a specific series of states or conditions.  For example   the  state  of  a  combination  lock  depends  not  only on what numeral is being dialed or punched at the moment  but  on  the  numbers  that  have  been  previously  entered.   An even simpler example is a counter (such as a car odometer)  whose  next  output  is  equal  to  one  increment  plus  its  cur-rent  setting.   In  other  words   a  state-based  device  has  an inherent â€œmemoryâ€ of previous steps.
