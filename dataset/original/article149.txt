148 The more than five-century-old art of typography (the design  arrangement  and setting of printing type) was transformed in the latter part of the 20th century by digital technology.  With the exception of some traditional presses devoted to the fine book market  nearly all type used today is designed and set by computer. Most users are familiar with the typefaces distributed with their operating system and software  such as the popular Adobe and TrueType  .  Many such font designs are based on (and sometimes named after) traditional typefaces  modified for readability using typical displays and printers. For control of composition  there are three overlapping levels of software  ranging from easiest to use (but most limited) to most complex  versatile  and precise.  Modern word processors such as Microsoft Word and Open Office provide enough control for many types of shorter documents  .  Desktop publishing software adds facilities suitable for layout of fliers  brochures  newsletters  and similar publications that often mix text and graphics  . More elaborate documents such as books  magazines  and newspapers require more sophisticated facilities to control the layout and flow of text.  Some traditional choices include LaTex (for the Tex typesetting program)  used particularly by scientists and other academics  and the older troff and its offshoots on UNIX systems.  More recent programs include Quark  FrameMaker  PageMaker  and InDesign.  Related utilities often used in digital typography include font editors (for design and modification) and utilities to convert fonts from one format to another
