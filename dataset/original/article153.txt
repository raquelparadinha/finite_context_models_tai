However  there are a variety of other interfaces that are used for particular circumstances or applications  such as:  touchscreens (as with ATMs)    handwriting or written â€œgestureâ€ recognition  such as on handheld computers   or for drawing tablets  voice-controlled systems    trackballs  joysticks  and touchpads (used as mouse alternatives)  virtual reality interfaces using head-mounted systems  sensor gloves  and so on  Because much interaction with computers is now away from the desktop and taking place on laptops  handheld  or palm computers  and even in cars  there is likely to be continuing experimentation with user interface design.
