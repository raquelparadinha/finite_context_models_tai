50 Because of its many practical features and its availability for the popular IBM 360 mainframes  PL/I enjoyed considerable success in the late 1960s and 1970s.  The language was later ported to most major platforms and operating systems.  When personal computers came along  PL/I became available for IBMâ€™s OS/2 operating system as well as for Microsoftâ€™s DOS and Windows  although the language never really caught on in those environments. Computer scientists such as structured programming guru Edsger Dijkstra decried PL/Iâ€™s lack of a clear  welldefined structure.  In his Turing Award Lecture in 1972  Dijkstra opined that â€œI absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming languageâ€”our basic tool  mind you!â€”already escapes our intellectual control. â€ (See Dijkstra  Edsger. )On a practical level the sheer number of features in the language meant that truly mastering it was a lengthy process.  A language like C  on the other hand  had a much simpler â€œcoreâ€ to master even though it was less versatile.  PL/I also tended to retain the mainframe associations from its birth at IBM  while C grew up in the world of minicomputers and the UNIX community and proved more suitable for PCs.  Nevertheless  PL/I provided many examples that language designers could use in attempting to design better implementations.
