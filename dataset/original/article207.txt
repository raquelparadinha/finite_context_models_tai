206 Intellectual  property  can  be  defined  as  the  rights  the  cre-ator  of  an  original  work  (such  as  an  invention  or  a  book) has  to  control  its  reproduction  or  use.   Developers  of  new computer  hardware   software   and  media  content  must  be able to realize a return on their time and effort.  This return is threatened by the ease with which programs and data on disks can be illicitly copied and redistributed.  Several legal mechanisms can be used to deter such behavior.
