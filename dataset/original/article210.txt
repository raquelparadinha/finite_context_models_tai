209 Image  processing  is  a  general  term  for  the  manipulation of  a  digitized  image  to  produce  an  enhanced  or  more  con-venient  version.   Some  of  the  earliest  applications  were  in the military (aerial and  later  satellite reconnaissance) and in  the  space  program.   The  military  and  space  programs had a great need for extracting as much useful information as  possible  from  images  that  were  often  gathered  under extreme or marginal conditions.  They also needed to make cameras  and  other  hardware  components  simultaneously more  compact  and  more  efficient   and  generally  had  the funds to pay for such specialized developments. Once  developed   higher-quality  image  processing  sys-tems found their way into other applications such as domes-tic  surveillance  and  medical  imaging.   The  development  of cameras that could directly turn light into digitized images   made image processing seam-less by avoiding the necessity of scanning images from tra-ditional film. Image  processing  applications  can  be  divided  into three general categories: enhancement  interpretation  and maintenance.
