405 Stream Cipher encrypts in small units  often a bit or a byte at a time.  Unlike abasic block cipher  a stream cipher will have output corresponding to a giveninput will depend on where in the message it occurs.  The simplest type ofstream cipher uses a complicated function  which retains state  to generatea pseudo-random sequence which is then combined with the input using asimple operation such as bytewise addition.
