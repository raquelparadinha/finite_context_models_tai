236 Bitmap  formats  have  the  advantage  of  storing  the  exact color  of  every  pixel  without  losing  any  information.   How-ever   this  means  that  the  files  can  be  very  large  (from hundreds  of  thousands  of  bytes  to  several  megabytes  for Windows  screen  graphics).   BmP  and  other  bitmap  formats do  support  a  simple  method  of  compression  called  run-length encoding (RLE)  where a series of identical pixels is replaced  by  a  single  pixel  and  a  count.   Bitmap  files  can  be further compressed through the use of utilities such as the popular Zip program
