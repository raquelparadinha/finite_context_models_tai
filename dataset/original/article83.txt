82 The operation of the head depends on the type of scanner.  In the most common type  the flatbed scanner  a motor moves the head back and forth across the paper  which lies facedown on a glass window.  In a sheet-fed scanner  the head remains stationery and the paper is fed past it by a set of rollers.  Finally  there are handheld scanners  where the job of moving the scanner head is performed by the user moving the scanner back and forth over the page.
