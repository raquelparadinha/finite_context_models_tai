44 The explosive growth of the World Wide Web has confronted programmers with the need to find ways to link databases and other existing resources to Web sites.  The specifications for such linkages are found in the Common Gateway Interface  .  However  the early facilities for writing CGI scripts were awkward and often frustrating to use. Back in 1986  UNIX developer Larry Wall had created a language called Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language).  There were already ways to write scripts for simple data processing   as well as a handy pattern-manipulation language  .  However  Wall wanted to provide a greater variety of functions and techniques for finding  extracting  and formatting data.  Perl attracted a following within the UNIX community.  Since much Web development was being done on UNIX-based systems by the mid- and late-1990s  it was natural that many webmasters and applications programmers would turn to Perl to write their CGI scripts. As with many UNIX scripting languages  Perlâ€™s syntax is broadly similar to C.  However  the philosophy behind C is to provide a sparse core language with most functionality being handled by standard or add-in program libraries.  Perl  on the other hand  starts with most of the functionality of UNIX utilities such as sed (stream editor)  C shell  and awk  including the powerful regular expressions familiar to UNIX users.  The language also includes a â€œhashâ€ data type (a collection of paired keys and values) that makes it easy for a program to maintain and check lists such as of Internet hosts and their IP addresses  .
