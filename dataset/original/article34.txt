33 An operating system is an overarching program that manages the resources of the computer.  It runs programs andprovides them with access to memory (RAM)  input/outputdevices  a file system  and other services.  It provides application programmers with a way to invoke system services  andgives users a way to control programs and organize files. The â€œcoreâ€ functions include â€œbootingâ€ the system and initializing devices  process management(loading programs intro memory assigning them a share ofprocessing time)  and allowing processes to communicatewith the operating system or one another  . Multiprogramming systems often implement not only processes (running programs) but also threads  or sections ofcode within programs that can be controlled separately. A memory management scheme is used to organize andaddress memory  handle requests to allocate memory  freeup memory no longer being used  and rearrange memory tomaximize the useful amount  . There is also a scheme for organizing data created orused by programs into files of various types  .  Mostoperating systems today have a hierarchical file system thatallows for files to be organized into directories or foldersthat can be further subdivided if necessary
