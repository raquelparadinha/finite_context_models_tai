129 By the 1990s  PC users generally used tapes only for making backups.  A typical backup tape drive uses DAT (digital audio tape) cartridges that hold from hundreds of megabytes to several gigabytes of data.  Most drives use a rotating assembly of four heads (two read and two write) that verify data as itâ€™s being written.  As a backup medium  tape has a lower cost per gigabyte than disk devices.  It is easy to use and can be set up to run unattended (except for periodically changing cartridges). However  since tapes are written and read sequentially  they are not convenient for restoring selected files  .  Many smaller installations now prefer using a second (â€œmirrorâ€) hard drive as backup  using disk arrays   or using recordable CDs or optical drives for smaller amounts of data  . Many large companies and government agencies have thousands of reels of tape stored away in their vaults since the 1960s  including data returned from early NASA space missions.  As time passes  it becomes increasingly difficult to guarantee that this archived data can be successfully read.  This is due both to gradual deterioration of the medium and the older data formats becoming obsolete  .
