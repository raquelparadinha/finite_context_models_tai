290 eBayeBay Inc.  (NASDAQ symbol: EBAY) is the worldâ€™s largest online auction and shopping site.  The first appearance of the auction service was in 1995 as AuctionWeb  part of the personal Web site of Pierre Omidyar  .  Omidyar was surprised at how rapidly the auction service (which was initially free) grew.  After he imposed a modest listing fee  Omidyar found himself receiving thousands of dollars in small checks  and decided that online auctions could become a full-time business.
