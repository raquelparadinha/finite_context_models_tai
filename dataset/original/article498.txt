497 The transfer of data within the microprocessor and between the microprocessor and memory must be synchronized to ensure that the data needed to execute each instruction is available when the flow of execution has reached an appropriate point.  This synchronization is accomplished by moving data in intervals that correspond to the pulses of the system clock (a quartz crystal).  This is done by sending control signals that tell the components of the processor and memory when to send or wait for data.  Thus  if the microprocessor is the heart of the computer  the clock is the heartâ€™s pacemaker.  Because most devices cannot run at the same pace as the processor  circuits in various parts of the motherboard create secondary control signals that run at various ratios of the actual system clock speed.
