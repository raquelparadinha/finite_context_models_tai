368 Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) uses HTTP but additionally activates web server securityâ€š in the form of Secure Socket Layer (SSL). This means that the communications between the client and the (host) webserver are encrypted andâ€š additionallyâ€š that the host web server may be validated by the client using a Digital Certificate on the server  . The URL for such web sites indicates that they are secure by the use ofâ€˜https://addressâ€™ (rather than http://address). Some may list this term as shttp instead of https.
