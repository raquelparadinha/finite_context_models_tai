125 Applications programmers write programs to help users work better  while systems programmers write programs to help the computer itself work better  .  Systems programmers generally work for companies in the computer industry that develop operating systems  network facilities  program language compilers and other software development tools  utilities  and device drivers.  However  systems programmers can also work for applications developers to help them interface their programs to the operating system or to devices  . Modern operating systems are highly complex  so systems programmers tend to specialize in particular areas.  These might include device drivers  software development tools  program language libraries  applications programming interfaces (APIs)  and utilities for monitoring system conditions and resources.  Systems programmers develop the infrastructure needed for networking  as well as multiple-processor computers and distributed computing systems.  Systems programmers also play a key role when an application program must be â€œportedâ€ to a different platform or simply modified to run under a new version of the operating system
