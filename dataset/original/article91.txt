90 The semantic Web is not something that can appear overnightâ€”after all  it will take considerable human effort to encode the information needed for machines to understand Web resources  and additional effort to code the application programs that will take advantage of that information.  However  the potential payoff is huge  allowing both human and automated searchers to tackle much more sophisticated tasks. For example  the University of Maryland is developing a prototype semantic search engine called Swoogle.  It can extract information and determine relationships between documents that include RDF or OWL elements.  Swoogle can also help users find appropriate ontologies for exploring a subject  . Much research needs to be done.  For example  there is the problem of deriving a measure of â€œreliabilityâ€ or â€œtrustâ€ based on the data sources used to answer the query  which may be scattered all over the world and represent very different kind
