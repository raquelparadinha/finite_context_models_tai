384 PHP is an HTML-embedded Web scripting language.  Accordinglyâ€š PHPcode can be inserted into the HTML of a Web page.  When a PHP page isaccessedâ€š the PHP code is read or â€œparsedâ€ by the server the page resides on. The output from the PHP functions on the page are typically returned asHTML codeâ€š which can be read by the browser.  Because the PHP code istransformed into HTML before the page is loadedâ€š users cannot view the PHPcode on a page.  This make PHP pages secure enough to access databases andother secure information. A lot of the syntax of PHP is borrowed from other languages such as Câ€šJava and Perl  .  Howeverâ€š PHP has a number of uniquefeatures and specific functions as well.  The goal of the language is to allowWeb developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly and easily. PHP is also helpful for creating database-driven Web sites.
