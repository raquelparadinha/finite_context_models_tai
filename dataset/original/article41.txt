40  With a parallel connection  however  the eight bitsof the byte are sent simultaneously  each along its own wire so parallel ports are generally faster than serial ports.  Also since the data is transmitted simultaneously  the protocolfor marking the beginning and end of each data byte is simpler.  On the other hand  parallel cables are more expensive(since they contain more wires) and are generally limitedto a length of 10 feet or so because of electrical interferencebetween the parallel wires. The original parallel interface for personal computerswas designed by Centronics  and a later version of this 36-pin connector remains popular today.  Later  IBM designed a25-pin version.  In addition to the wires carrying data  additional wires are used to carry control signals
