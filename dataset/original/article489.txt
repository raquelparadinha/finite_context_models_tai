The popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was developed in Finland by Jarkko Oikarinen in the late 1980s.  Using one of the freely available client programs  users connect to an IRC server  which in turn is connected to one of dozens of IRC networks.  Users can create their own chat rooms (called channels).  There are thousands of IRC channels with participants all over the world.
