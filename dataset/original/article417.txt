416 In the earliest programming languages  any part of a program could access any other part simply by executing an instruction such as â€œjumpâ€ or â€œgoto. â€ Later  the concept of the subroutine helped impose some order by creating relatively self-contained routines that could be â€œcalledâ€ from the main program.  At the time the subroutine is called  it is provided with necessary data in the form of global variables or (preferably) parameters  which are variable references or values passed explicitly when the subroutine is called.  When the subroutine finishes processing  it may return values by changing global variables or changing the values of variables that were passed as parameters
