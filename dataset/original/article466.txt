465 Introduced in 2002  C# (pronounced â€œC sharpâ€) is a programming language similar to C++ and Java but simplified in several respects and tailored for use with Microsoftâ€™s latest programming platform  .  C# is a general-purpose language and is thoroughly objectorientedâ€”all functions must be declared as members of a class or â€œstruct â€ and even fundamental data types are derived from the System. Object class  . Compared with C++  C# is stricter about the use and conversion of data types  not allowing most implicit conversions (such as from an enumeration type to the corresponding integerâ€”see data structures).  Unlike C++  C# does not permit multiple inheritance (where a type can be derived from two or more base types)  thereby avoiding an added layer of complexity in class relationships in large software projects.  (However  a similar effect can be obtained by declaring multiple â€œinterfacesâ€ or specified ways of accessing the same class. )Unlike Java (but like C++)  C# includes pointers (and a safer version called â€œdelegatesâ€)  enumerations (enum types)  structs (treated as lightweight classes)  and overloading (multiple definitions for operators).  The latest version of the language  C# 3. 0 (introduced in 2007)  provides additional features for list processing and functional programming
