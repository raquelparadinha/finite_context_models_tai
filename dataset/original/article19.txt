18 Different kinds of objects often have analogous methods. For example  suppose there is a series of classes that represent various polygons: square  triangle  hexagon  and so forth.  Each class has a method called â€œperimeterâ€ thatreturns the total distance around the edges of the object.  Ifeach of these classes is derived from a base polygon class each class inherits the base classâ€™s perimeter method andadapts it for its own use.  Thus  a square might calculateits perimeter simply by multiplying the length of a side byfour  while the rectangle would have to add up differentsized pairs of sides  and so on.
