189 Lists are generally used to provide convenient access to rel-atively  small  amounts  of  data  where  flexibility  is  required.  Unlike an array  a list need use only as much memory as it needs to accommodate the current number of items (includ-ing their associated pointers).  A LISP-style node list can be even  more  flexible  in  that  items  with  varying  sizes  and types of data can be included in the same list.  Lists are thus a  more  flexible  way  to  implement  such  things  as  look-up tables.
