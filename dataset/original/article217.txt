216 Even  after  decades  of  evolution  in  computing   the  hard disk  drive  remains  the  primary  means  of  fast  data  storage and  retrieval  in  computer  systems  of  all  sizes.   The  disk itself consists of a rigid aluminum alloy platter coated with a  magnetic  oxide  material.   The  platter  can  be  rotated  at speeds of more than 10 000 rpm.  A typical drive consists of a stack of such platters mounted on a rotating spindle  with a read/write head mounted above each platter. Early  hard  drive  heads  were  controlled  by  a  stepper motor  which positioned the head in response to a series of electrical pulses.  (This system is still used for floppy drives. ) Todayâ€™s hard drives  however  are controlled by a voice-coil actuator   similar  in  structure  to  an  audio  speaker.   The  coil surrounds a magnet.  When a current enters the coil  it gen-erates a magnetic field that interacts with that of the perma-nent magnet  moving the coil and thus the disk head.  Unlike the stepper motor  the voice coil is continuously variable and its  greater  precision  allows  data  tracks  to  be  packed  more tightly on the platter surface  increasing disk capacity. The  storage  capacity  of  a  drive  is  determined  by  the number  of  platters  and  the  spacing  (and  thus  number)  of tracks  that  can  be  laid  down  on  each  platter.   Capacities have  steadily  increased  while  prices  have  plummeted:  In 1980   for  example   a  hard  drive  for  an  Apple  II  microcom-put  er cost more than $1 000 and held only 5 mB of data.  As of  2007  internal  hard  drives  with  a  capacity  of  500 gB  or more cost around a $150. 00.
