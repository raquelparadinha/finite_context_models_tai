459 Distributed computing is particularly suited to applications that require extensive computing resources and that may need to be scaled (smoothly enlarged) to accommodate increasing needs  .  Examples might include large databases  intensive scientific computing  and cryptography.  A particularly interesting example is SETI@home  which invites computer users to install a special screen saver that runs a distributed process during the computerâ€™s idle time.  The process analyzes radio telescope data for correlations that might indicate receipt of signals from an extraterrestrial intelligence  . Besides being able to marshal very large amounts of computing power  distributed systems offer improved fault tolerance.  Because the system is decentralized  if a particular computer fails  its processes can be replaced by ones running on other machines.  Replication (copying) of data across a widely dispersed network can also provide improved data recovery in the event of a disaster
