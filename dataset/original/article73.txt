72 IBM did succeed in creating RPG (Report Program Generator)  a language designed to make it easier for programmers (including beginners) to generate business reports. Most COBOL programs read data  perform tests and calculations  and print the results.  RPG  first released in 1964 for use with the new System/360 mainframe and the smaller System/3  simplifies this process and eliminates most writing of program code statements. A â€œclassicâ€ RPG program is built around the â€œRPGcycle â€ consisting of three stages.  During the input stage  the input device(s)  file type  access specifications  and data record structure are specified.  (These specifications can be quite elaborate. ) The heart of the program specifies calculations to be performed with the various data fields  while the output section specifies how the results will be laid out in report form  including such things as headers  footers  and sections. Subsequent versions of RPG added more features.  RPGIV  released in 1994  includes the ability to define subroutines  for example.  IBM has also released VisualAge RPG  which allows for the creation and running of RPG programs in the Microsoft Windows environment.  There are also tools for interfacing RPG programs with various database systems and to use RPG for writing Web-based (CGI) programs
