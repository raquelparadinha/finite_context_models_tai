247 grid  or  cluster  computing  involves  the  creation  of  a  sin-gle  computer  architecture  that  consists  of  many  separate computers  that  function  much  like  a  single  machine.   The computers  are  usually  connected  using  fast  networks   .   The  purpose  of  the  arrangement can  be  to  provide  redundant  processing  in  case  of  system failures   to  dynamically  balance  a  fluctuating  work  load  or  to  split  large  computations  into  many  parts  that  can  be performed  simultaneously.   This  latter  approach  to  â€œhigh-performance computingâ€ creates the virtual equivalent of a very large and powerful machine.
