128 Anyone who has seen computers in old movies is familiar with the row of large  freestanding tape cabinets with their spinning reels of tape.  The visual cue that the computer was running consisted of the reels thrashing back and forth vigorously while rows of lights flashed on the computer console.  Magnetic tape was indeed the mainstay for data storage in most large computers   in the 1950s through the 1970s. In early mainframes the main memory (corresponding to todayâ€™s RAM chips) consisted of â€œcoreâ€â€”thousands of tiny magnetized rings crisscrossed with wires by which they could be set or read.  Because core memory was limited to a few thousand bytes (kB)  it was used only to hold the program instructions   and to store temporary working data while the program was running. The source data to be processed by the program was read from a reel of tape on the drive.  If the program updated the data (rather than just reporting on it)  it would generally write a new tape with the revised data.  In large facilities a person called a tape librarian was in charge of keeping the reels of tape organized and providing them to the computer operators as needed.
