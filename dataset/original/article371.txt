370 Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is the â€œnext generationâ€ protocol designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to replace the currentversion Internet Protocol  IP Version 4 (â€œIPv4â€). Most of todayâ€™s internet uses IPv4  which is now twenty years old.  IPv4has been remarkably resilient in spite of its age  but it is beginning to haveproblems.  Most importantly  there is a growing shortage of IPv4 addresses which are needed by all new machines added to the Internet. IPv6 fixes a number of problems in IPv4  such as the limited number ofavailable IPv4 addresses.  It also adds many improvements to IPv4 in areassuch as routing and network autoconfiguration.  IPv6 is expected to graduallyreplace IPv4  with the two coexisting for a number of years during a transitionperiod  .
