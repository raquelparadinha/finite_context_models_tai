139 The alternative is to connect the remote participant to a mobile robot (this is sometimes called telerobotics).  Such robots already exist  although their capabilities are limited and they are not yet widely used for meetings.  RodneyBrooks  director of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  foresees a not very distant future in which such robots will be commonplace. The robot will have considerable built-in capabilities  so the person who has â€œroboted inâ€ to it wonâ€™t need to worry about the mechanics of walking  avoiding obstacles  or focusing vision on particular objects.  Seeing and acting through the robot  the person will be able to move around an environment as freely as persons who are physically present.  The operator can give general commands amounting to â€œwalk over thereâ€ or â€œpick up this objectâ€ or perform more delicate manipulations by using his or her hands to manipulate gloves connected to a force-feedback mechanism. Brooks sees numerous applications for robotic telepresence.  For example  someone at work could â€œrobot inâ€ to his or her household robot and do things such as checking to make sure appliances are on or off  respond to a burglar alarm  or even refill the catâ€™s food dish.  Robotic telepresence could also be used to bring expertise (such as that of a surgeon) to any site around the world without the time and expense of physical travel.  Indeed  robots may be the only way (for the foreseeable future) that humans are likely to explore environments far beyond Earth  .
