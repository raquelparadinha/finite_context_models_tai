476 During the late 1950s and 1960s  software rapidly grew more complexâ€”especially operating system software and large business applications.  With the typical program consisting of many components being developed by different programmers  it became difficult both to see the â€œbig pictureâ€ and to maintain consistent procedures for transferring data from one program module to another.  As computer scientists worked to develop sounder principles   it also occurred to them that the power of the computer to automate procedures could be used to create tools for facilitating program design and managing the resulting complexity.  CASE  or computer-aided software engineering  is a catchall phrase that covers a variety of such tools involved with all phases of development
