256 Optical  fiber  has  several  advantages  over  ordinary  electric cable  for  communications  and  networking.   The  signals  can travel much farther without the need for a repeater to boost the  signal.   Also   the  ability  to  modulate  wavelengths  allows optical fiber to carry many separate channels  greatly increas-ing the total data throughput.  Optical fiber does not emit RF (radio  frequency)  energy   a  source  of  â€œcross  talkâ€  (interfer-ence) in electrical cable.  Fiber is also more secure than elec-trical cable because it is hard for an eavesdropper to tap. Today  fiber  is  used  for  most  long-distance  phone  lines and Internet  connections.  many  cable  television  systems are  upgrading  from  video  cable  to  fiber  because  of  its greater reliability and ability to carry more bandwidth and enhanced data services.
