153 Dating back to the mid-1990s  VBScript is a scripting language developed by Microsoft and based on its popular Visual Basic programming language  .  It is also part of the evolution of what Microsoft called â€œactive scripting â€ based on components that allow outside access to the capabilities of applications.  The host environment in which scripts run is provided through Windows (as with Windows Script Host) or within Microsoftâ€™s Internet Explorer browser. For client-side processing  VBScript can be used to write scripts embedded in HTML pages  which interact with the standard Document Object Model   in a way similar to other Web scripting languages (in particular  see JavaScript).  However  VBScript is not supported by popular non-Microsoft browsers such as Firefox and Opera  so developers generally must use the widely compatible JavaScript instead.  VBScript can also be used for processing on the Web server  particularly in connection with Microsoftâ€™s Web servers  . Because versions of Windows starting with Windows 98 include Windows Script Host  VBScripts can also be written to run directly under Windows.  One unfortunate consequence was scripts containing worms (such as the I LOVE YOU worm) or other malware and mailed as attachments to unwary use
