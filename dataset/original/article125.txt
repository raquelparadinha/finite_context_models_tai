124 The systems analyst serves as the bridge between the needs of the user and the capabilities of the computer system.  The systems analyst goes into action when users request that some new application or function be provided (usually in a corporate computing environment). The first step is to define the userâ€™s requirements and to prepare precise specifications for the program.  In doing so  the systems analyst is aided by methodologies developed by computer scientists over the last several decades  .  Often flowcharts or other aids are used to help visualize the operation of the program  . After communicating with the user  the systems analyst must then communicate with the programmers  helping them understand what is needed and reviewing their work as they begin to design the program.  Although the systems analyst may do little actual programming  he or she must be familiar with programming tools and practices.  This may make it possible to suggest existing software or components that could be adapted instead of undertaking the cost and time involved with creating a new program.  As a program is developed  systems analysts are often responsible for designing tests to ensure that the software works properly
