351 e-Government is the publicâ€™s efforts to bring dealings with the governmentonline  thereby enabling citizens to conduct most of their businesses (e. g.  ordering a passport) online.  Accordingly  while the UK wants every government transaction to be offered online by 2005  Denmark has chosen toprovide all of its citizens with digital signatures to enable them to do all theirtransactions online  . Pushing e-Government initiatives requires satisfactory IT security of information  data and protection of peopleâ€™s privacy which can be a challenge. For instance in 2002  Canadaâ€™s Auditor General released a report in which itstated that government sites do not seem to do well as far as privacy and datasecurity are concerned.  His 2003 report acknowledged some improvementsbut did not yet give e-Government sites a passing grade.  Quite likely  othergovernments may have to improve on this score as well. As Table 9 suggests  putting down a policy about e-government and ITinitiatives is important.  The hard work follows thereafter.  Providing everycitizen with a digital signature is a start but  without addressing the issuesin Table 9  it is unlikely to improve service for citizens.  Accordingly  governments will have to learn how to manage the changed relationships withtheir citizens and business thanks to e-government.  Also  Identity Theft maybecome an issue thanks to increased use of digital signatures by citizensinteracting with the government.
