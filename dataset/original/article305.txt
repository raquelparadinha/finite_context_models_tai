304 Active OS Fingerprinting is conducted in order to detect the targetâ€™s Oper ating System.  It is usually done by sending specially crafted network packets and comparing them against known responses.  Each operating system re sponds to different packet differently and even response to the ping command can give a good indication of the target OS.  Several methods have been developed and fingerprints are widely available on the internet.  The tool of the trade for this is a tool called Network Mapper (nmap).  While Active OS Fingerprinting is more accurate than Passive OS Fingerprinting  it has a significant disadvantage.  Being active  means that attackers have to send packets to the host  hence  Active versus passive Fingerprinting means risking discovery  .
