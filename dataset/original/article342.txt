341 is considered to take place only when accessto a computer or network resource is intentionally blocked or degraded as aresult of malicious action taken by another user.  While these attacks coulddamage data directly or permanently they do not have to.  However  theyintentionally compromise the availability of the resources.  An attacker carriesout a denial-of-service attack by making a resource inoperative  by taking upso much of a shared resource that none of the resource is left for other users or by degraded the resource so that it is less valuable to users.  Those sharedresources are reached through processes and can include other processes shared files  disk space  percentage of CPU  modems  etc.  DoS is an attack based on the principles of the TCP Three-way Handshakeexploitation.  It was very popular in late 1990s.  Flooding system by speciallycrafted packets from one host could disable its networking capabilities andin some cases even force it to reboot.  Majority of the exploitable holes werepatched and this form of attack is nowadays nearly impossible.
