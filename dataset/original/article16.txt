15 Integers (whole numbers) have the simplest representation  but there are two important considerations: the totalnumber of bits available and whether one bit is used to holdthe sign. Since all numbers are stored as binary digits  an unsignedinteger has a range from 0 to 2bits where â€œbitsâ€ is the totalnumber of bits available.  Thus if there are 16 bits available  the maximum value for an integer is 65535.  If negativenumbers are to be handled  a signed integer must be used(in most languages such as C  C++  and Java  an integer issigned unless unsigned is specified).  Since one bit is usedto hold the sign and each bit doubles the maximum size  itfollows that a signed integer can have only half the rangeabove or below zero.  Thus  a 16-bit signed integer can rangefrom -32 768 to 32 767. One complication is that the available sizes of integersdepend on whether the computer systemâ€™s native data sizeis 16  32  or 64 bits.  In most cases the native size is 32 bits so the declaration â€œintâ€ in a C program on such a machineimplies a signed 32-bit integer that can range from - 231 or-2 147 483 647 to 231-1  or 2 147 483 647.  However  if one isusing large numbers in a program  it is important to checkthat the chosen type is large enough.  The long specifier isoften used to indicate an integer twice the normal size  or64 bits in this case.
