262 File-sharing services allow participants to provide access to files  on  their  personal  computers   such  as  music  or  video.  In turn  the user can browse the service to find and down-load material of interest.  The structure is generally that of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network with no central server. The  first  major  file-sharing  service  was  Napster.   This was  a  P2P  network  but  had  a  central  server  that  provided the  searchable  list  of  files  and  locationsâ€”but  not  the  files themselves    which   were   downloaded   from   usersâ€™   PCs.  Napster  was  forced  to  close  in  2001  by  legal  action  from copyright  holders   .   A  new  but  unrelated  for-pay  service  opened  later under the same name.
