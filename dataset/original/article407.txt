406 Just as the way business is organized and conducted has been profoundly changed by information and communications technology  the operation of government at all levels has been similarly affected.  The term e-government (or electronic government) is a way of looking at these changes as a whole and of considering how government uses (or might use) various computer applications. The use of information technology in government can involve changes in the organization and internal communications of government departments  changes in how services are delivered to the public  and providing new ways for the public to interact with the agency. Internally  government agencies have many of the same information management and sharing needs as private enterprises  .  However  government agencies are likely to have to adapt their information systems to account for complex  specialized regulations (both those the agency administers and others it is subject to).  The standards of openness and accountability are generally different from and stricter than those that apply to private organizations.
