63 By combining mirroring  error correction  and/or striping  different â€œlevelsâ€ of RAID can be implemented to suit different needs.  There are various trade-offs: Striping can increase access speed  but uses more storage space and  by increasing the number of disks  also increases the chance that one will fail.  Implementing error correction can make failure recoverable  but slows data access down because data has to be read from more than one location and compared. The most commonly used RAID levels are:  RAID 0â€”striping data across disks  higher speed but no error correction; failure of any disk can make data unrecoverable  RAID 1â€”mirroring (data stored on at least two disks)  data intact as long as one disk is still operating  RAID 3 and 4â€”striping plus a dedicated disk for parity (error checking)  RAID 5â€”striping with distributed parity; data can be restored automatically after a failed disk is replaced  RAID 6â€”like RAID 5 but with parity distributed so that data remains intact unless more than two drives failIn actuality  RAID configurations can be very complex  where different levels can be â€œlayeredâ€ above one another  with each treating the next as a virtual drive  until one gets down to the actual hardware.  Although RAID is often implemented using a physical (hardware) controller  operating systems can also create a virtual RAID structure in software  interposed between the logical drive as seen by the read/write routines and the physical drives.
