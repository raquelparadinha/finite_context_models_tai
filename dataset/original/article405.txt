404 Steganography (â€œhidden writingâ€) is a form of data hiding.  Unlike cryptography  which creates an unreadable version of a message for anyone withoutthe key  Steganography conceals even the existence of secret messages.  Oneof the earliest forms of Steganography is spread-spectrum radio transmissions  in which parts of a message (even parts of individual bits) are senton pseudo-randomly varying radio frequencies; without the right equipment the signal is merely electronic white noise. Steganography circumvents restrictions on encryption and preventsSIGINT (signals intelligence) personnel from detecting encrypted traffic. Digital watermarks and copy-protection schemes are forms of Steganography used to reduce the ease of illegal copying of intellectual property and totrace the origin of files  . There are many tools available for embedding secret messages in otherfiles; for instance  MP3STEGO modifies MP3 audio files to hold messages. Steganalysis tools look for tell-tale patterns in changed data when lookingfor concealed messages.
