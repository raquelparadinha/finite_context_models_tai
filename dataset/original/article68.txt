67 The benefits of RFID technology are numerous: better inventory control  ; more secure passports and other forms of ID; faster  easier access to transportation systems; and potentially  the avoidance of mishaps in hospitals  such as the wrong patient receiving a drug or procedure. However  there are privacy and security concerns that remain to be fully resolved.  The primary threat is that unauthorized persons could illicitly obtain information or track people or goods  for purposes ranging from simple larceny to identity theft.  Privacy rights organizations have also raised concerns that information about consumer purchases could be used for unwanted marketing (or sold to third parties)  while information about a library patronâ€™s reading habits could trigger unwarranted government investigations in the name of fighting terrorism. There is an incentive to produce RFID cards and tags that are resistant to unauthorized reading or tampering.  A cryptographic protocol can be used such that no information will be sent or received unless the reader and tag â€œknowâ€ the correct keys.  Another possibility is to create a device that can â€œjamâ€ reading attempts in the deviceâ€™s vicinity  perhaps protecting a customerâ€™s grocery cart from being scanned.  Finally  RFID cards can be put inside in a sleeve of material that blocks the signals.  However  cryptographic and other security technologies raise the cost of RFID devices and may make them impracticable for some applications. In September 2006 the National Science Foundation awarded a $1. 1 million grant to the RFID Consortium for Security and Privacy to study potential risks and safeguards for the technology.  That same year a group of major corporations together with the National Consumers League released a draft set of standards and guidelines for best practices in using RFID  with broader scope than the existing EPC (electronic product code) standard
