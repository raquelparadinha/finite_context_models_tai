71 Moving toward greater autonomy  we have the â€œservice robotsâ€ that have begun to show up in some institutions such as hospitals and laboratories.  These mobile robots are often used to deliver supplies.  For example  the HelpMate robot can travel around a hospital by itself  navigating using an internal map.  It can even take an elevator to go to another floor. Service robots have had only modest market penetration  however.  They are relatively expensive and limited in function  and if relatively low-wage more versatile human labor is available  it is generally preferred.  For now mobile robots and service robots are most likely to turn up in specialized applications in environments too dangerous for human workers  such as in the military  law enforcement  handling of hazardous materials  and so on.
