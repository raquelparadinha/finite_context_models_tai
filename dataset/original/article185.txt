184 Whatever memory chips or other devices are installed in a computer   the  operating  system  and  application  programs must  have  a  way  to  allocate   use   and  eventually  release portions of memory.  The goal of memory management is to use available memory most efficiently.  This can be difficult in  modern  operating  environments  where  dozens  of  pro-grams may be competing for memory resources. Early  computers  were  generally  able  to  run  only  one program at a time.  These machines didnâ€™t have a true oper-ating  system   just  a  small  loader  program  that  loaded  the application  program   which  essentially  took  over  control of the machine and accessed and manipulated the memory.  Later systems offered the ability to break main memory into several  fixed  partitions.   While  this  allowed  more  than  one program to run at the same time  it wasnâ€™t very flexible.
