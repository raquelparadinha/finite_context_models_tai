The cheapest kind  CD-R (Compact Disk Recordable) uses a layer of a dyed material and a thin gold layer to reflect the laser beam.  Data is recorded by a laser beam hitting the dye layer in precise locations and marking it (in one of several ways  depending on technology).  The lengths of marked (â€œstripedâ€) track and unmarked track together encode the data.
