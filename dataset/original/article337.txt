336 cyberpunks embody behaviors similar to what we define as Crackers andphone phreaks but  in addition  they use technology to damage  destroy orcapitalize on the data they find (e. g.   for profit).  Most importantly  cyberpunksuse their know how to gain more information which  in turn  increases theirinfluence  power and potential threat upon othersâ€™ information world.  Mostof this activity is done at somebody elseâ€™s expense by  for example  breakingand entering into an organizationâ€™s voice mail system.  Gaining unauthorizedaccess and using IT resources and process while not being authorized to doso  . Similar to the things we learned in Economics 101  demand and supply ofgoods are related.  Accordingly  cyberpunks can be compared to â€œfencesâ€ inNew York who sell stolen merchandise at very â€œattractiveâ€ prices.  As longas there is a consumer who is willing to go home with a â€œgoodâ€ deal  even ifit is at the expense of the victim whose apartment / car was broken into  thenthe supply will continue.  If we stop purchasing from fences supply will drop;if cyberpunks find no demand for their illegally acquired information and therefore fail to sell their goods  supply will be reduced  . Finally  providing individual cyberpunks with five minutes of fame doesfurther reinforce the cool image or status the individual is striving for withinhis or her social group.  Lack of attaining fame  status or other benefits (e. g.  being on a TV show) will also help reduce the supply of cyberpunks.
