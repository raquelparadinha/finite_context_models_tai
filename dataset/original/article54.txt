53 Podcasting (from iPod plus broadcasting) lets users subscribe to and automatically download regularly distributed content (such as radio broadcasts) over the Internet.  The media files can be stored on an Apple iPod or other media player    personal computer  or other device  .  Podcasting became popular starting around 2004â€“05 and has become widely used by individuals and organizations. Typically  files to be podcast are put on a Web server.  The URLs for the files and other information (such as episode titles) is provided in files called feeds  using a format such as RSS or Atom  .  The user installs client software (such as iPodder)  browses the feeds (such as through an online directory)  and decides what to subscribe to.  The software then periodically checks the feeds  obtains the URLs of the latest files  and downloads them automatically.  The software can  if desired  then transfer the downloaded files to a portable media player  such as over a USB connection
