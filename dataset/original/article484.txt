483 Governments have always to varying degrees concerned themselves with the content of public media.  The growing use of the Internet for expressive activities   has prompted authoritarian governments such as that of China to attempt to block â€œobjectionableâ€ material both through filtering techniques   and through pressure on service providers.  Further  users identified as creators of banned content may be subjected to prosecution.  However because of the Internetâ€™s decentralized structure and the ability of users to operate relatively anonymously  Internet censorship tends to be only partially effective  . In the democratic West  Internet censorship generally applies to only a few forms of content.  Attempts to criminalize the online provision of pornography to minors in the 1996 Communications Decency Act have generally been overturned by the courts as excessively infringing on the right of adults to access such content.  However  a succession of bills seeking to require schools and libraries to install Web-filtering software culminated in the Childrenâ€™s Internet Protection Act  which was upheld by the U. S.  Supreme Court in 2003.
