136 Prior to the court-ordered breakup of AT&T in 1984  the phone industry functioned in a monolithic way and was not very responsive to the needs of the growing computer networking industry. The breakup of AT&T led to growing competition  providing a wider variety of telecommunications equipment and lower phone rates just as PC users were starting to buy modems and sign up with online services and bulletin boards.  The growing deregulation movement in the 1990s (culminating in the Telecommunications Act of 1996) furthered this process by opening cable and broadcast television  radio  and other wireless communication to competition. With more than half of American Internet users on high-speed connections    the delivery of communications and media over the Net can only grow.  Wireless and mobile services (satellite  cell network  and 802. 11â€”see wireless computing) have also been growing vigorously.  The result is that the â€œinformation highwayâ€ now has many lanes  with some being express lanes.
