This allowed the typist to record keystrokes (and some data such as margin settings) on tape.  Material could be corrected by being rerecorded.  The tape could then be used to print as many perfect copies of the document as required.  A version using magnetic cards instead of tape appeared in 1969. The first modern-style word processor was marketed by Lexitron and Linolex.  It also used magnetic tape  but it added a video display screen.  Now the writer could see and correct text without having to print it first.  A few years later  a new invention  the floppy disk  became the standard storage medium for dedicated word processing systems. The word-processing systems developed by Wang  Digital Equipment Corporation  Data General  and others became a feature in large offices in the late 1970s.  These systems were essentially minicomputers with screens  keyboards  and printers and running a specialized software program.  Because these systems were expensive (ranging from about $8 000 to $20 000 or more)  they were not affordable by smaller businesses.  Typically  they were operated by specially trained personnel (who became known also as â€œword processorsâ€) to whom documents were funneled for processing  as with the old â€œtyping poo
