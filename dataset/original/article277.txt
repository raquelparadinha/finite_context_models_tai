276 Smart  mobs  are  similar  in  organization  to  flash  mobs  but tend  to  be  more  purposeful  and  enduring  forms  of  social organization.  The phenomenon was first described by How-ard  Rheingold  in  his  book Smart  Mobs:  The  Next  Social Revolution  .  Rheingold describes several examples of smart mobs  including teenage â€œthumb tribesâ€ in Tokyo and Helsinki  Finland (named for their use of  tiny  thumb-operated  keyboards  on  cell  phones).   Their typical  activities  included  organizing  impromptu  raves  or converging on rock stars or other celebrities.
