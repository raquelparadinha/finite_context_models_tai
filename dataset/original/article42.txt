41 After many years of effort researchers have been able tocreate systems that can recognize particular human faces .  On the other hand  any normalsix-month-old child can effortlessly recognize familiarfaces (such as parents).  The fundamental task of turningraw data (whether from senses  instruments  or computerfiles) into recognizable objects or drawing inferences iscalled pattern recognition.  Pattern recognition is at theheart of many areas of research and application in computing  . Despite the challenge in getting machines to do what comes naturally for biological organisms  the potentialpayoffs are immense. A pattern-recognition system begins with data  whetherstored or real-time (such as from a robotâ€™s camera).  The firsttask in turning potentially billions of bytes of data intomeaningful objects is to extract features from what is likelya high proportion of redundant or irrelevant data.  (Withvisual images  this often involves finding edges that defineshapes. ) The extracted features are then classified to determine what objects they might represent.  This can be doneby comparing structures to templates or previously classified data or by applying statistical analysis to determine thelikely correlation of the new data to existing patterns  . Pattern recognition often includes learning algorithmsas well; indeed  the field is often considered to be a subtopicof machine learning.  For example  classification systemscan be refined by â€œtrainingâ€ them and reinforcing successful determinations  .
