8 In the 1940s  the main objective in developing the first digital computers was to speed up the process of calculation.  In the 1950s  the machines began to be used for more general data-processing tasks by governments and business.  By the 1960s  computers were in use in most major academic  government  and business organizations.  The desire for users to share data and to communicate both within and outside their organization led to efforts to link computers together into networks. Computer manufacturers began to develop proprietary networking software to link their computers  but they were limited to a particular kind of computer  such as a DEC PDP minicomputer  or an IBM mainframe.  However  the U. S.  Defense Department  seeing the need for a robust  decentralized network that could maintain links between their computers under wartime conditions  funded the development of a protocol that  given appropriate hardware to bridge the gap  could link these disparate networks  .
