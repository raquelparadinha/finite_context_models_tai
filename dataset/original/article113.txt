112 All of the sorting algorithms discussed so far rely upon some form of comparison.  However  it also possible to sort records by calculating their relative positions or distribution  .  In its simplest form  an array can be created whose range of indexes is equal to 1 to the maximum possible key value.  Each key is then stored in the index position equal to its value (that is  a record with a key of 2314 would be stored in the array at position Array[2314].  This procedure works well  but only if the keys are all integers  the range is small enough to fit in memory  and there are no duplicate keys (since a duplicate would in effect overwrite the record already stored in that position). A more practical approach is to use a formula (hash function) that should create a unique hash value for each key.  The function must be chosen to minimize â€œcollisionsâ€ where two keys end up with the same hash value  which creates the same problem as with duplicate keys.  A hash sort is quite efficient within those constraints
