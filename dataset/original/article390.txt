389 Protocol is a set of formal rules describing how to transmit data  especiallyacross a network.  Low level protocols define the electrical and physicalstandards to be observed  bit- and byte-ordering and the transmission anderror detection and correction of the bit stream.  High level protocols dealwith the data formatting  including the syntax of messages  the terminal tocomputer dialogue  character sets  sequencing of messages etc.  Protocols are therefore  a set of rules that define how communications should take place as they are common formulas that enable two separate computers to â€˜speakâ€™with and â€˜understandâ€™ each other. The first group of protocols includes the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) family  used for communication via Internet. Other examples are such as HTTP that is used for Web page communications being a subset of TCP/IP
