449 Design patterns are an attempt to abstract and generalize what is learned in solving one problem so that it can be applied to future similar problems.  The idea was first applied to architecture by Christopher Alexander in his book A Pattern Language.  Alexander described a pattern as a description of situations in which a particular problem occurs  with a solution that takes into account the factors that are â€œinvariantâ€ (not changed by context).  Guidance for applying the solution is also provided. For example  a bus stop  a waiting room  and a line at a theme park are all places where people wait.  A â€œplace to waitâ€ pattern would specify the problem to be solved (how to make waiting as pleasant as possible) and suggest solutions.  Patterns can have different levels of abstraction or scales on which they apply (for example  an intimate theater and a stadium are both places of entertainment  but one is much larger than the other). Patterns in turn are linked into a network called a pattern language.  Thus when working with one pattern  the designer is guided to consider related patterns.  For example  a pattern for a room might relate to patterns for seating or grouping the occupants.
