140 The term template is used in a several contexts in computing  but they all refer to a general pattern that can be customized to create particular products such as documents. In a word processing program such as Microsoft Word  a template (sometimes called a style sheet) is a document that comes with a particular set of styles for various elements such as titles  headings  first and subsequent paragraphs  lists  and so on.  Each style in turn consists of various characteristics such as type font  type style (such as bold)  and spacing.  The template also includes properties of the document as a whole  such as margins  header  and footer. To create a new document  the user can select one of several built-in templates for different types of documents such as letters  faxes  and reports  or design a custom template by defining appropriate styles and properties.  Special sequences of programmed actions can also be attached to a template  . Templates can be created and used for applications other than word processing.  A spreadsheet template consists of appropriate macros and formulas in an otherwise blank spreadsheet.  When it is run  the template prompts the user to enter the appropriate values and then the calculations are performed.  A database program can have input forms that serve in effect as templates for creating new records by inputting the necessary data.
