156  the computing field  virtualization involves the creation of a working model or representation of one system within a different system.  This idea has been widely used in the field since the 1960s.  Some applications of virtualization include:  An appropriate model of a system (such as a programming frameworkâ€”see application programming interface) that hides unneeded details can make it easier for programmers to understand and access its functions  .   A compiler for a language that compiles all programs to an intermediate representation (such as â€œbytecodeâ€).  A virtual machine running on each kind of platform can then run the code  taking care of the details required by the host hardware  .   A virtual machine created in software can be designed to perform all the functions available on a particular hardware platform or operating system  allowing software to be run on a system different from the one for which it was originally written  .  For example  there are a number of virtualization programs (such as VMWare for PCs) that can create separate areas in memory  each running a different operating system  such as a version of Windows or Linux.  ? Multiple processors or entire computers can be treated as a single entity for processing a program  with software designed to assign threads of execution to physical processors and to coordinate the use of shared data  .   A physical device such as a disk drive can be made to appear as several separate devices to the operating system (for better organization of data).  Similarly  many servers can run on the same physical machine.  Conversely  multiple drives can appear to be a single logical device while providing redundancy and error recovery  .   A secure â€œvirtual private networkâ€ can be created within the larger public Internet.  The virtual system takes care of encrypting and transmitting data through the physical network.
