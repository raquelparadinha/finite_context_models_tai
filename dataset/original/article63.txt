62 Python is particularly useful for system administrators  webmasters  and other people who have to link various files  data source  or programs to perform their daily tasks.  The language currently has a small but growing (and quite enthusiastic) following. Without the semicolons and braces found in C and related languages  Python looks rather like BASIC.  Also note that the type of input data doesnâ€™t have to be declared.  The runtime mechanism will assume itâ€™s numeric from the expression found in the print statement.  Python programs thus tend to be shorter and simpler than C  Java  or even Perl programs.  The simple syntax and lack of data typing does not mean that Python is not a â€œseriousâ€ language  however.  Python contains full facilities for object-oriented programming  for example. Python programs can be written quickly and easily by trying commands out interactively and then converted the script to bytecode  a machine-independent representation that can be run on an interpreter designed for each machine environment.  Alternatively  there are translation programs that can convert a Python script to a C source file that can then be compiled for top speed.
