60 Computing is a complex  pervasive  and increasingly vital human activity.  It is not surprising that human psychology can play an important role in many aspects of computer use. Since the 1960s psychology (in particular see cognitivescience) has contributed to the structuring of interaction between computer systems and users  .  It is important to note the significant differences between how computers and humans perceive and process information: computers are extremely fast in processing in a highly structured setting (e. g.   a program).  The human brain  on the other hand  while thousands of times slower  is thus far greatly superior in coping with loosely structured data through pattern recognition  the making of analogies  and generalization.  A number of researchers   have promoted the idea of creating a human-computer synergy where the structure of the system takes advantage of both the machineâ€™s computational and data-retrieval abilities and the human userâ€™s ability to work with the larger picture.  Such research is continuing as autonomous software   and is beginning to interact with Web user
