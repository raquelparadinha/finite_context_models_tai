191 The  idea  behind  an  operating  system  kernel  is  that  there is  a  relatively  small  core  set  of  â€œprimitiveâ€  functions  that are necessary for the operation of system services  .   These  functions  can  be  provided  in  a single component that can be adapted and updated as desir-able.  The fundamental services include:     Process controlâ€”scheduling  how  the  processes  (pro-grams or threads of execution within programs) share the CPU  switching execution between processes  cre-ating  new  processes   and  terminating  existing  ones  .        Interprocess   communicationâ€”sending   â€œmessagesâ€ between  processes  enabling  them  to  share  data  or coordinate their data processing.        memory   managementâ€”allocating   and   freeing   up memory  as  requested  by  processes  as  well  as  imple-menting  virtual  memory   where  physical  storage  is treated as an extension of main (RAm) memory.  (See memoRymanagement. )     File  system  servicesâ€”creating   opening   reading  from  writing to  closing  and deleting files
