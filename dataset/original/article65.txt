64 Back in the days of mechanical clocks  curious kids would sometimes take a clock apart to try to figure out how it worked.  A few were even able to reassemble the clock correctlyâ€”these youngsters were likely to become engineers! With software  reverse engineering is the process of â€œtaking apartâ€ software and analyzing its operation without having access to the program code itself.  Among other possibilities  reverse engineering may allow one to:  provide equivalent functions without violating copyright laws  emulate one operating system within another    determine a file format so other programs can use it as well (interoperability)  document the operation of a program whose documentation is lost or no longer available  determine whether a competing product violates oneâ€™s patents or copyrights
