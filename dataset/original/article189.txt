188 A list is a series of data items that can be accessed sequen-tially  by  following  links  from  one  item  to  the  next.   Lists can be very useful for ordering or sorting data items and for storing them on a stack or queue. There  are  two  general  approaches  to  constructing  lists.  In a data list used with procedural programming languages such  as  C   each  list  item  consists  of  a  structure  consisting of a data member and a pointer.  The pointer  called â€œnext â€ contains the address of the next item.  A program can easily â€œstep throughâ€ a list by starting with the first item  process-ing  its  data   then  using  the  pointer  to  move  to  the  next item   continuing  until  some  condition  is  met  or  the  end  of the list is reached.
