119 Web users increasingly have access to such content as news broadcasts  songs  and even full-length videos.  The problem is that the user must receive the content in real time at a steady pace  not in sputters or jerks.  However  factors such as load on the Web server and network congestion between the server and user can cause delays in transmission.  One way to reduce the problem would be to compress the data  .  However  excessive compression would compromise audio or picture quality to an unacceptable extent.  Fortunately  a technology called streaming offers a way to smooth out the transmission of large amounts audio or video content  . When a user clicks on an audio or video link  the player software (or Web browser plug-in) is loaded and the transmission begins.  Typically  the player stores a few seconds of the transmission    so any momentary delays in the transmission of data packets will not appear as the data starts to play.  Assuming the rate of transmission remains sufficient  enough data remains in the buffer so that data can be â€œfedâ€ to the playing software at a steady pace.  If  however  there is too much delay due to network congestion  the playback will pause while the player refills its buffer
