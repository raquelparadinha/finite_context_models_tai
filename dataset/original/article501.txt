500 Cognitive science is the study of mental processes such as reasoning  memory  and the processing of perception.  It is necessarily an interdisciplinary approach that includes fields such as psychology  linguistics  and neurology.  The importance of the computer to cognitive science is that it offers a potential nonhuman model for a thinking entity.  The attempts at artificial intelligence over the past 50 years have used the insights of cognitive science to help devise artificial means of reasoning and perception.  At the same time  the models created by computer scientists (such as the neural network and Marvin Minskyâ€™s idea of â€œmultiple intelligent agentsâ€) have in turn been applied to the study of human cognition
