185 If  computers  were  merely  fast  sequential  calculators   they would still be of some use.  However  much of the power of the  computer  comes  from  its  ability  to  carry  out  repetitive tasks  without  supervision.   The loop  is  the  programming language  structure  that  controls  such  activities.   Virtually every language has some form of loop construct  with vari-ations  in  syntax  ranging  from  the  relatively  English-like COBOL  and  Pascal  to  the  more  cryptic  C.
