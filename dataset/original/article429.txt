For example  pressing a key on the keyboard sends a signal that is stored in a memory buffer using a value that represents the ASCII character code for the key pressed.  Moving the mouse sends a stream of signals that are proportional to the rotation of the ball which in turn is calibrated into a series of coordinates and ultimately to a position on the screen where the cursor is to be moved.  Digital cameras and scanners convert the varying light levels of what they â€œseeâ€ into a digital image
