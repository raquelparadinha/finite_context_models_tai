175 Zuse was born on June 22  1910  in Berlin.  He stud-ied civil engineering at the Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg  receiving his degree in 1935.  One of histasks in engineering was performing calculations of thestress on structures such as bridges.  At the time these cal-culations were carried out by going through a series of stepson a form over and over again  plugging in the data andcalculating by hand or using an electromechanical calcula-tor.  Like other inventors before him  Zuse began to wonderwhether he could build a machine that could carry outthese repetitive steps automatically.  departing from other calculator designers). The Z1 had trouble storing and retrieving numbers andnever worked well.  Undeterred  Zuse began to develop anew machine that used electromechanical telephone relays(a ubiquitous component that was also favored by HowardAiken [see Aiken  Howard]).  The new machine workedmuch better  and Zuse successfully demonstrated it at theGerman Aerodynamics Research Institute in 1939. With World War II under way  Zuse was able to obtainfunding for his Z3  which was able to carry out automaticsequences from instructions. Zuseused spare time from his military duties at the Henschelaircraft company to work on the Z4  which was completedin 1949.
