219 Starting  in  the  late  1950s   in  computer  facilities  at mIT  Stanford   and  other  research  universities  people  began  to encounter  persons  who  had  both  unusual  programming skill  and  an  obsession  with  the  inner  workings  of  the machine.   While  ordinary  users  viewed  the  computer  sim-ply  as  a  tool  for  solving  particular  problems   this  peculiar breed of programmers reveled in extending the capabilities of  the  system  and  creating  tools  such  as  program  editors that  would  make  it  easier  to  create  even  more  powerful programs.  The movement from mainframes that could run only one program at a time to machines that could simulta-neously  serve  many  users  created  a  kind  of  environmental niche  in  which  these  self-described hackers  could  flourish.  Indeed   while  administrators  sometimes  complained  that hackers  took  up  too  much  of  the  available  computer  time  they  often  depended  on  them  to  fix  the  bugs  that  infested the  first  versions  of  time-sharing  operating  systems.   Hack-ers also tended to work in the wee hours of the night while normal users slept.
