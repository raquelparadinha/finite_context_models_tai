302 A  class  is  a  data  type  that  combines  both  a  data  structure and  methods  for  manipulating  the  data.   For  example   a string  class  might  consist  of  an  array  to  hold  the  charac-ters in the string and methods to compare strings  combine strings   or  extract  portions  of  a  string   . As  with  other  data  types   once  a  class  is  declared  objects  (sometimes  called  instances)  of  the  class  can  be created  and  used.   This  way  of  structuring  programs  is called   object-oriented   programming   because   the   class object  is  the  basic  building  block   . Object-oriented  programming  and  classes  provide  sev-eral advantages over traditional block-structured languages.  In  a  traditional  BASIC  or  even  Pascal  program   there  is no  particular  connection  between  the  data  structure  and the  procedures  or  functions  that  manipulate  it.   In  a  large program  one  programmer  might  change  the  data  structure without  alerting  other  programmers  whose  code  assumes the  original  structure.   On  the  other  hand   someone  might write  a  procedure  that  directly  manipulates  the  internal data rather than using the methods already provided.  Either transgression can lead to hard-to-find bugs. With  a  class   however   data  and  procedures  are  bound together   or  encapsulated.   This  means  that  the  data  in  a class  object  can  be  manipulated  only  by  using  one  of  the methods  provided  by  the  class.   If  the  person  in  charge of  maintaining  the  class  decides  to  provide  an  improved implementation  of  the  data  structure   as  long  as  the  data parameters  expected  by  the  class  methods  do  not  change  code  that  uses  the  class  objects  will  continue  to  function properly.
