426 Abstract data types are used to describe a â€œgenericâ€ type of data  specifying how the data is stored and what operations can be performed on it  . DFor example  an abstract stack data type includes a structure for storing data (such as a list or array) and a set of operations  such as â€œpushingâ€ an integer onto the stack and â€œpoppingâ€ (removing) an integer from the stack.  (For the process of combining data and operations into a single entity  see encapsulation. ) Abstract data types can be implemented directly in object-oriented programming languages
