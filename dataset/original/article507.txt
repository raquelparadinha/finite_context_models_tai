506 A compiler is a program that takes as input a program written in a source language and produces as output an equivalent program written in another (target) language.  Usually the input program is in a high-level language such as C++ and the output is in assembly language for the target machine  . Compilers are useful because programming directly in low-level machine instructions (as had to be done with the first computers) is tedious and prone to errors.  Use of assembly language helps somewhat by allowing substitution of symbols (variable names) for memory locations and the use of mnemonic names for operations (such as â€œadd for addition  rather than some binary instruction code).  An assembler is essentially a compiler that needs to make only relatively simple translations  because assembly language is still at a relatively low level.
