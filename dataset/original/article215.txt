214 A hash  is  a  numeric  value  generated  by  applying  a  math-ematical  formula  to  the  numeric  values  of  the  characters in a string of text  .  The for-mula is chosen so that the values it produces are always the same  length  (regardless  of  the  length  of  the  original  text) and  are  very  likely  to  be  unique.   (Two  different  strings should  not  produce  the  same  hash  value.   Such  an  event  is called a collision. )
