201    Telnet  is  another  fundamental  service  that  brought the  Internet  much  of  its  early  utility.   Telnet  allows  a user at one computer to log into another machine and run a program there.  This provided an early means for users  at  PCs  or  workstations  to   for  example   access the  Library  of  Congress  catalog  online.   However   if program  and  file  permissions  are  not  set  properly  on the  â€œhostâ€  system   telnet  can  cause  security  vulner-abilities.   The  telnet  user  is  also  vulnerable  to  having IDs and passwords stolen  since these are transmitted as  clear  (unencrypted)  text.   As  a  result   some  online sites  that  once  supported  telnet  access  now  limit access to Web-based forms.  (Another alternative is to use a program called â€œsecure shellâ€ or ssh  or to use a telnet client that supports encryption. )
