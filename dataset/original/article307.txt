306 are similar to Java applets in that ActiveX controls may be includedwithin a web page.  The control is downloaded and executed on the browserâ€™scomputer in the form of a pre-compiled executable.  Unfortunately  ActiveXdoes not enforce any form of security management technology.  Hence  ActiveX control has the same level of control of the client computer as theuser that is executing the browser.  ActiveX controls are specific to MicrosoftInternet Explorer (MSIE). ActiveX controls are elements that can be added to web pages  therebyproviding them with more functionality (e. g.   animation  video  and threedimensional browsing).  The controls are written in programming languagessuch as Visual Basic  C or C++.  They are written in a different code than theone used for the web pages itself such as HTML.  They could  however  beinfected with malicious code (Malware). Whatever risks are associated with running native executables on a computer also apply to ActiveX.  How security of ActiveX controls is handled isat the userâ€™s discretion who runs the browser.  Without appropriate training this may be risky  justifying disabling this functionality within webbrowsers by setting security settings to â€˜high â€™ ActiveX is prevented fromrunning
