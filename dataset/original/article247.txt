246 Fabrication of computer chips in more than 200 large plants around the world involves a variety of toxic chemicals and waste products.  The Silicon Valley alone is home to 29 toxic sites under the EPAâ€™s Superfund Program.  The shift of much of semiconductor and computer component manufacturing to  countries  such  as  China  that  have  less  strict  pollution controls  has  also  exacerbated  what  has  become  a  global problem. Whether through regulation or enlightened self-interest  companies  that  want  to  reduce  future  emissions  can  use several strategies.  manufacturing equipment and processes can be modified so they create fewer toxic substances or at least  keep  them  from  getting  into  the  environment.   Non-toxic  (or  less  toxic)  materials  can  be  substituted  where possibleâ€”for  example   use  of  ozone-depleting  chlorofluo-rocarbons (CFCs) as cleaning agents has been largely elimi-nated.   Finally   waste  can  be  properly  sorted  and  disposed of  and recycled wherever feasible. Like  other  major  manufacturing  sectors   the  computer industry  is  also  faced  with  the  need  to  reduce  the  amount of  the  greenhouse  gases  (particularly  CO2)  contributing  to global  warming.   This  mainly  means  further  reducing  the energy  consumption  of  new  PCs.   In  June  2007  a  number of  major  players   including google   Intel   Dell   Hewlett-Packard  microsoft  and Sun  established the Climate Savers Computing  Initiative.  going  beyond  Energy  Star   the  pro-gram  is  expected  to  reduce  power  consumption  equivalent to 54 million tons of greenhouse gases annuallyâ€”about the same  as  that  produced  by  11  million  cars  or  20  large  coal-fired power plants.
