269 many programs and operating systems are structured as an endless  loop  where  an  input  (or  command)  is  processed  the  results  returned   the  next  input  is  processed   and  so on  until an exit command is received.  A mode or state can be  used  to  determine  the  systemâ€™s  activity.   For  example   a program  might  be  in  different  modes  such  as  waiting  for input   processing  input   displaying  results   and  so  on.   The program  logic  will  refer  to  the  current  state  to  determine what  to  do  next  and  at  some  point  the  logic  will transitionthe system to the next state in the sequence.  The validity of some kinds of programs  protocols  or circuits can therefore be proven by showing that there is an equivalent finite-state machineâ€”and thus that all possible combinations of inputs have been accounted for. Finite-state machines have many other interesting appli-cations.  Simple organisms can be modeled as a set of states that  interact  with  the  environment .  The lower-level functions of robots can also be represented as  a  set  of  interacting  finite-state  machines.   Even  video game characters often use FSms to give them a repertoire of plausible behavior.
