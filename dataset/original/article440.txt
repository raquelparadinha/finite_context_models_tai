439 The developer of each application program that writes data files must define a format for the data.  The format must be able to preserve all the features that are supported by the program.  For example  a word processing program will include special codes for font selection  typestyles (such as bold or italic)  margin settings  and so on. In most markets there are more than one vendor  so there is the potential for users to encounter the need to convert files such as word processing documents from one vendorâ€™s format to another.  For example  a Microsoft Word user needing to send a document to a user who has WordPerfect  or the user may encounter another user who also has Microsoft Word  but a later version.
