172 Typically  a wireless LAN uses a frequency band with each unit on a slightly different frequency  thus allowing all units to communicate without interference.  (Although radio frequency is now most popular  wireless LANs can also use microwave links  which are sometimes used as an alternative to Ethernet cable in large facilities. )Usually there is a network access point  a PC that contains a transceiver and serves as the network hub (it may also serve as a bridge between the wireless network and a wired LAN).  The hub computer can also be connected to a high-speed Internet service via DSL or cable.  It has an antenna allowing it to communicate with wireless PCs up to several hundred feet away  depending on building configuration. Each computer on the wireless network has an adapter with a transceiver so it can communicate with the access point.  The adapter can be built-in (as is the case with some handheld computers)  or mounted on a PC card (for laptops) or an ISA card (for desktop PCs) or connected to a USB port.
