160 At least as currently implemented  VoIP does have some disadvantages:  Like cordless phones (but unlike traditional phones)  VoIP requires that the user be connected to power.  This may make the system unavailable in an emergency.   Also  in an emergency  a 911 operator has no way to know where the caller is located geographically.  This could be a problem if the caller is unable to provide this information.   While a regular phone is a pretty simple device  VoIP requires special hardware or a PC  which might fail.   VoIP requires a working Internet connectionâ€”in practice  a high-speed connection  .  Load or instability in the network could cause interruptions in calls or a lowering of voice quality.   As with other data sent over the Internet  there are potential security concerns.  Encryption can be used to secure VoIP calls  but this in turn leads to concerns by law enforcement agencies seeking to implement eavesdropping warrants.
