289 At  bottom   a  data  bit  in  a  computer  is  â€œall  or  nothingâ€ (1  or  0).  most  decisions  in  computer  code  are  also  all  or nothing: Either a condition is satisfied  and execution takes one  specified  path   or  the  condition  is  not  satisfied  and  it goes  elsewhere.   In  real  life   of  course   many  situations  fall between the cracks.  For example  a business might want to treat  a  credit  applicant  who  almost  qualifies  for  â€œAâ€  status different  from  one  who  barely  made  â€œB. â€  While  a  program could be refined to include many gradations between B and A  another approach is to express the degree of â€œclosenessâ€ (or certainty) using fuzzy logic.
