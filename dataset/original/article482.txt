481 The DVD (alternatively  Digital Video Disc or Digital Versatile Disc) is similar to a CD  but uses laser light with a shorter wavelength.  This means that the size of the pits and lands will be considerably smaller  which in turns means that much more data can be stored on the same size disk.  A DVD disk typically stores up to 4. 7 GB of data  equivalent to about six CDs.  This capacity can be doubled by using both sides of the disk. The high capacity of DVD-ROMs (and their recordable equivalent  DVD-RAMs) makes them useful for storing feature-length movies or videos  very large games and multimedia programs  or large illustrated encyclopedias.  The development of high-definition television (HDTV) standards spurred the introduction of higher capacity DVD formats.  The competition between Sonyâ€™s Blu-Ray and HD-DVD (backed by Toshiba and Microsoft  among others) was resolved by 2008 in favor of the former.  BluRay offers high capacity (25GB for single layer discs  50GB for dual layer).
