482 Cellular automata theory has been applied to a variety of fields that deal with the complex interrelationships of components  including biology (microbe growth and population dynamics in general)  ecology (including forestry)  and animal behavior  such as the flight of birds.  (The cues that a bird identifies in its neighbors are like the input conditions for a cell in a cellular automaton.  The â€œoutputâ€ would be the birdâ€™s flight behavior. )The ability of cellular automatons to generate a rich complexity from simple components and rules mimics the development of life from simple components  and thus cellular automation is an important tool in the creation and study of artificial life.  This can be furthered by combining a set of cellular automation rules with a geneticalgorithm  including a mechanism for inheritance of characteristics.  Cellular automation principles can also be applied to engineering in areas such as pattern or image recognition
