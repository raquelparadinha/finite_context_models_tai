322 Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a plan to ensure that the essential business functions of the organization are able to continue (or re-start) in the event of unforeseen circumstances; normally a disaster of some sort  .  The BCP follows the Disaster Recovery Plan  .  BCP identifies the critical people and their roles and functions while the BCP is in forceâ€š informationâ€š systemsâ€š and other infrastructures (e. g. â€š telephonesâ€š serversâ€š SMS gateways) that are required to enable the business to operate again fully.  The BCP lays out a detailed plan whichâ€š if called uponâ€š should be executed to assure minimum additional disruption after a massive computer Virus Attack or disaster.  Companies that do not have clear business continuity plans remain very vulnerable.  Good recovery from a disaster isâ€š howeverâ€š contingent upon peopleâ€š processes and training.  Finallyâ€š management awareness may be the main weakness in business continuity planning.  Doing the basics well is they keyâ€š whereby if one says one will take his or her data off site within 24 hours of a calamityâ€š one must make sure that this is being done.  Henceâ€š fire drills or â€˜dress rehearsalsâ€™ by simulating various disaster scenarios will permit the organization to be in a better positionâ€š while recovering faster after a disaster.  Henceâ€š business continuity and disaster recovery plans need to be exercised so that kinks may be worked out before the crisis hits.
