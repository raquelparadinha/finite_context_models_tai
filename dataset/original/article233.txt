232 google  Inc.   (NASDAQ  symbol: gOOg)  has  built  a  busi-ness  colossus  by  focusing  on  helping  users  find  what  they are  looking  for  on  the  Internet  while  selling  advertising targeted at those same users.  By 2006  â€œto googleâ€ could be found in dictionaries as a verb meaning to look up anyone or anything online. goog  le was founded by two Stanford students    who   for  their  doctoral  thesis  had described a Web search algorithm that could give a bet-ter  idea  of  the  likely  relevance  of  a  given  site  based  on  the number  of  sites  that  linked  to  it.   The  two  students  imple-mented  a  search  engine  based  on  their  ideas  and  hosted  it on  the  Stanford  Web  site   where  its  popularity  soon  irri-tated  the  universityâ€™s  system  administrators.   In  1998  their bus  iness  was  incorporated  as google   Inc.    and  moved  to the  archetypal  Silicon  Valley  entrepreneurâ€™s  locationâ€”a friendâ€™s  garage.   However   as  the  company  attracted  invest-ment  capital  and  grew  rapidly   it  moved  to  Palo  Alto  and the  n its present home in mountain View. googleâ€™s  initial  public  stock  offering  was  in  2004   and the   marketâ€™s   enthusiastic   response   made   many   senior employees  instant  millionaires.  googleâ€™s  steady  growth  in subsequent  years  has  kept  its  stock  in  demand   reaching  a record  peak  of  $560  in  September  2007.   (In  2006 google was added to the S&P 500 Index. )
