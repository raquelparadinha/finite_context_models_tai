490 With simple rules but endless permutations  chess has fascinated millions of players for hundreds of years.  When mechanical automatons became fashionable in the 18th century  onlookers were intrigued by â€œthe Turk â€ a chessplaying automaton.  While the Turk was eventually shown to be a hoax (a human player was hidden inside)  the development of the electronic digital computer in the mid-20th century provided the opportunity to create a true automatic chess player. In 1950 Claude Shannon outlined the two basic strategies that would be used by future chess-playing programs.  The â€œbrute forceâ€ strategy would examine the possible moves for the computer chess player  the possible replies of the opponent to each move  the possible next moves by the computer  and so on for as many half moves or â€œpliesâ€ as possible.  The moves would be evaluated by a â€œminimaxâ€ algorithm that would find the move that best improves the computerâ€™s position despite the opponentâ€™s best play.
