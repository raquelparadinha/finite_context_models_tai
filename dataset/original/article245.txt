244 Computers consume a variety of resources  starting with their manufacturing and packaging.  Resource consumption can be reduced  by  building  more  compact  units  and  by  designing components so they can be more readily stripped and recycled or  reused.   Adopting  reusable  storage  media  (such  as  rewrit-able  CDs)   recycling  printer  toner  cartridges   and  changing office  procedures  to  minimize  the  generation  of  paper  docu-ments are also ways to reduce resource consumption.
