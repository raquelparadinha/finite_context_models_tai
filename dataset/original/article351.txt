350 A dynamic link library (DLL) is a collection of small programs that larger programs can load when needed to complete specific tasks.  The small program  called a DLL file  contains instructions that help the larger program handle what may not be a core function of the original program. An example of those tasks might be communicating with a specific device  such as a printer or scanner to process a document.  DLL files that support specific device operations are known as device drivers. DLL contains bits of code and data  like classes and variables  or other resources such as images that the larger program can use. In addition to being a generic term for dynamic link libraries  Dynamic Link Library is also the name of Microsoft's version of the shared library concept for Windows.  A shared library can exist in any operating system (OS).
