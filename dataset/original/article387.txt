386 Port Address Translation (PAT) is communication technology used byrouters to allow multiple users in a local network to accessâ€”with their ownIP addressâ€”the Internet or corporate networks via a single public address. PAT actually translates multiple private IP addresses to a single public addressâ€š or to a public sub networkâ€š recognized by the IP service provider.  Thisfunction can reduce operating costsâ€š increase security and simplify Internetaccess. If an attacker wants to access ports connected to the 3Com OfficeConnectRemote 812 ADSL router the router will not allow this connection.  Howeverâ€šfirmware versions V1. 1. 9 and V1. 1. 7 had a confirmed vulnerability that ifa connection is made to a redirected port using PAT and then to any portnot redirected using PATâ€š the router allows the successive connections to anyport.  The problem exists with TCP and with UDP.
