222 game  consoles  are  computer  devices  dedicated  to  (or  pri-marily  used  for)  playing  video  games.   The  earliest  such devices  appeared  in  the  1970s  from magnavox  and  then Atari  and could only play simple games like Pong (a crude simulation  of  ping-pong).   Slightly  later  systems  began  to feature cartridges that allowed them to play a greater vari-ety of games.
