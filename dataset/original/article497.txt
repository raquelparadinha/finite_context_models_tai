496 There are several advantages to using the client-server model.  Having most of the processing done by one or more servers means that these powerful and more costly machines can be used to the greatest efficiency.  If more processing capacity is needed  more servers can be brought online without having to revamp the whole system.  Users  on the other hand  only need PCs (or terminals) that are powerful enough to run the smaller client program to connect to the server. Keeping the data in a central location helps ensure its integrity: If a database is on a server  transactions can be committed in an orderly way to ensure that  for example  the same ticket isnâ€™t sold to two people.  A client-server model also offers flexibility to users.  Any client program that meets the standards supported by the server can be used to make a connection.
