58 The dot-matrix printer  which came into common use in the 1980s  uses a different principle of operation than typewriter-style printers.  Unlike the latter  the dot-matrix printer does not form solid characters.  Instead  it uses an array of magnetically controlled pins (9 pins at first  but 24 on later models).  Each character is formed by pressing the appropriate pins into a ribbon that pushes into the paper  leaving a pattern of tiny dots. Besides being relatively inexpensive  dot-matrix printers are versatile in that a great variety of character styles or fonts can be printed    either by loading different sets of bitmaps.  Likewise  graphic images can also be printed.  However  because the characters are made of tiny dots  they donâ€™t have the crisp  solid look of printed type
