260 The  growth  in  desktop  computing  since  the  1980s  has resulted  in  much  data  being  moved  from  mainframe  com-puters  to  desktop  PCs   which  are  now  usually  linked  by networks.  While a network enables users to exchange files  there  remains  the  problem  of  storing  large  files  or  collec-tions of files (such as databases) that are too large for a typi-cal PC hard drive or that need to be accessed and updated by many users. The  common  solution  is  to  obtain  a  computer  with large   fast  disk  drives   .   This  computer   the file  server   is  equipped  with  software  (often  included  with the  networking  package)  that  serves  (provides)  files  as requested  by  users  or  applications  on  the  other  PCs  on the  network.   (See  also client-seRveRcomputing. )  The specifics  of  configuring  the  server  for  optimum  efficiency  providing  adequate  security   and  arranging  for  backup  or archiving varies with the particular network operating sys-tem  in  use  (the  most  popular  environments  are  Windows NT  Vista  and the various versions of UNIx and Linux)
