464 The C programming language was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie  who based it on the earlier languages BCPL and B.  C was first used on DEC PDP-11 computers running the newly developed UNIX operating system  where the language provided a high-level alternative to the use of PDP Assembly language for development of the many utilities that give UNIX its flexibility.  Since the 1980s  C and its descendent  C++  have become the most widely used programming languages.
