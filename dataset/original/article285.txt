284 A key feature of Forth is its extensibility.  Once you have defined a word  the new word can be used in exactly the same way  as  the  predefined  words.   The  various  forms  of defining words allow for great control over what happens when a new word  is  created  and  when  the  word  is  later  executed.   (In many ways Forth anticipated the principles of object-oriented programming  with words as objects with implicit construc-tors and methods.  A well-organized Forth program builds up from  â€œprimitiveâ€  operations  to  the  higher-level  words   with the program itself being the highest-level word. )
