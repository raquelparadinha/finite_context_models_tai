34 Designers of modern operating systems face a numberof continuing challenges:  security  in a world where nearly all computers arenetworked  often continuously    the tradeoff between powerful  attractive functionssuch as scripting and the security vulnerabilities theytend to present  the need to provide support for new applications suchas streaming audio and video    ease of use in installing new devices  The continuing development of new user-interfaceconcepts  including alternative interfaces for the disabled and for special applications    the growing use of multiprocessing and multiprogramming  requiring coordination of processors sharingmemory and communicating with one another    distributed systems where server programs  clientprograms  and data objects can be allocated amongmany networked computers  and allocations continually adjusted or balanced to reflect demand on thesystem    the spread of portable  mobile  and handheld computers and computers embedded in devices such asengine control systems  .  (Sometimes the choice isbetween devising a scaled-down version of an existing operating system and designing a new OS that isoptimized for devices that may have limited memoryand storage capacity. )
