438 The process of removing redundant information from data so that it takes up less space is called data compression.  Besides saving disk space  compressing data such as e-mail attachments can make data communications faster. Compression methods generally begin with the realization that not all characters are found in equal numbers in text.  For example  in English  letters such as e and s are found much more frequently than letters such as j or x. By assigning the shortest bit codes to the most common characters and the longer codes to the least common characters  the number of bits needed to encode the text can be minimized
