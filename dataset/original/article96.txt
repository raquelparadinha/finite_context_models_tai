95 To see a simple shell in action  a Windows user need only bring up a command prompt  type the word dir  and press Enter.  A shell called command. com provides the user interface for users of IBM PC-compatible systems running MS-DOS.  The command processor displays a prompt on the screen.  It then interprets   the userâ€™s commands.  If the command involves one of the shellâ€™s internal operations (such as â€œdirâ€ to list a file directory)  it simply executes that routine.  For example the command:dir temp /pwould be interpreted as a call to execute the dir function  passing it the name â€œtempâ€ (a directory) and the /p  which dir interprets as a â€œswitchâ€ or instruction telling it to pause the directory listing after each screenful of text.  If the command is an external MS-DOS utility such as â€œxcopyâ€ (a file copying program)  the shell runs that program  passing it the information (mainly file names) from the command line.  Finally  the shell can run any other executable program on the system.  It is then that programâ€™s responsibility to interpret and act upon any additional information that was provided. MS-DOS also has the ability for the command. com shell to read a series of commands stored in a text file called a batch file  and having the *. bat (batch) extension.  This allowed for rudimentary scripting of system housekeeping operations or other routine tasks  .
