470 A disk cache uses the same general principle as a processor cache.  Here  however  it is RAM (either a part of main memory or separate memory on the disk drive) that is the faster medium and the disk drive itself that is slower.  When an application starts to request data from the disk  the cache reads one or more complete blocks or sectors of data from the disk rather than just the data record being requested.  Then  if the application continues to request sequential data records  these can be read from the high-speed memory on the cache rather than from the disk drive.  It follows that disk caching is most effective when an application  for example  loads a database file that is stored sequentially on the disk
