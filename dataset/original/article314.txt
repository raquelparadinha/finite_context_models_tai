313 Authentication results in positively verifying the identity of a userâ€š deviceâ€š or another entity in an information system.  This is often a prerequisite for allowing access to resources offered by a system.  One element that contributes to the reliability of individual authentication is good password management practices.  In an area of high riskâ€š stronger authentication may be required such as: Asymmetric Keysâ€”see Access Control Biometricsâ€”see Biometrics Cryptographic Tokensâ€”see Cryptography Digital Certificatesâ€”see Digital Certificate Smart Cardsâ€”see Smart Card One-Time Password Generatorsâ€”where password can be used once only.  Stronger authentication relies on combining one or more of the following: password / Pin or something else user knowsâ€š token or other meansâ€š that is something user hasâ€š and finallyâ€š biometrics or other technique enabling system to identify who the person is.  The above means may be used to verify the true source of a message or data.  But all approaches have their weak spots and combinations of measures are usually more effective.  In case of electronic votingâ€š the term refers to verification that an electronic ballot really comes from the person it claims to have been initiated byâ€š and not from an imposter.
