110 The quicksort improves on the basic bubble sort by first choosing a record with a key approximately midway between the lowest and highest.  This key is called the pivot.  The records are then moved to the left of the pivot if they are lower than it  and to the right if higher (that is  the records are divided into two partitions).  The process is then repeated to split the left side with a new pivot  and then the right side likewise.  This is continued until the partition size is one  and the records are now all sorted.  (Because of this repeated partitioning  quicksort is usually implemented using a procedure that calls itself repeatedlyâ€”see recursion. )Devised by C.  A.  R.  Hoare in 1962  quicksort is much faster than the bubble sort because records are moved over greater distances in a single operation rather than simply being exchanged with their neighbors.  Assuming an appropriate initial pivot value is chosen  running time is proportional to the logarithm of n rather than to the square of n. The difference becomes dramatic as the size of the database increases
