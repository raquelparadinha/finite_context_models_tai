145 Many computer applications involve the arrival of a set of data that must be processed in a specified way.  For example  a bankâ€™s ATM system receives a customerâ€™s request to deposit money together with identification of the account and the amount to be deposited.  The system must accept the deposit  update the account balance  and return a receipt to the customer.  This is an example of real-time transaction processing. Some applications process transactions in batches.  For example  a company may run a program once a month that generates paychecks and withholding stubs from employee records that include hours worked  number of dependents claimed  and so on.  Indeed  in the ATM example  the account balance is typically not updated during the on-line transaction  but instead a batch transaction is stored.  Overnight that transaction will be processed together with other transactions affecting that account (such as checks)  and the balance will then be officially updated.  (The program module that keeps track of the progress of transactions is called a transaction monitor. )
