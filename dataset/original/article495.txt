494 A class is a data type that combines both a data structure and methods for manipulating the data.  For example  a string class might consist of an array to hold the characters in the string and methods to compare strings  combine strings  or extract portions of a string  . As with other data types  once a class is declared  objects (sometimes called instances) of the class can be created and used.  This way of structuring programs is called object-oriented programming because the class object is the basic building block  . Object-oriented programming and classes provide several advantages over traditional block-structured languages.  In a traditional BASIC or even Pascal program  there is no particular connection between the data structure and the procedures or functions that manipulate it.  In a large program one programmer might change the data structure without alerting other programmers whose code assumes the original structure.  On the other hand  someone might write a procedure that directly manipulates the internal data rather than using the methods already provided.  Either transgression can lead to hard-to-find bugs.
