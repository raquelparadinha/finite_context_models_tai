297 BASIC was invented at Dartmouth College in 1963â€“1964 by John G.  Kemeny and Thomas E.  Kurtz  both professors of mathematics  assisted by a group of undergraduate student programmers.  Computers then were huge  slow  and expensive; there were no personal computers.  Their goal was to bring easy and accessible computing to all students  not just science or engineering students.  The method they chose called for developing a time-shared operating system  which would allow many users simultaneously.  (This operating system was developed entirely by Dartmouth undergraduate students. ) The new language  BASIC  easy to learn and easy to use  was an essential part of this effort.  BASIC was thus developed originally for a large multipleuser  time-shared system and not for personal computers  which did not appear widely until the early 1980s.  It has been asked whyBASICwas invented.  Couldnâ€™t an existing language have been used for the purpose? The answer to the second question is no  which also answers the first question.  Other computer languages did exist in 1963  although there were not nearly as many as there are today.  The principal ones were FORTRAN and Algol; most of the others are long since forgotten.  Some of the common languages used todayâ€”C  C++  and Javaâ€”had not even been conceived.  FORTRAN and Algol were each considered briefly.  These languages were designed for production use on big machines or for scientific research  using punched cards.  But neither was suitable for use by beginners  neither was particularly well suited for a time-shared environment  and neither permitted speedy handling of short programs.  Kemeny and Kurtz had experimented with other simple computer languages as early as 1956  but with only modest success.  So  in 1963  when they began building a time-shared system for students  they quickly realized that a new language had to be inventedâ€”BASIC.
