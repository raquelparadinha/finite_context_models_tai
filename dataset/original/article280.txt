279 Until  the  mid-1990s   the  floppy  disk  or  diskette  was  the primary  method  for  distributing  software  and  providing removable  data  storage  for  personal  computers.   Diskettes first appeared in the late 1960s on IBm minicomputers  and became  more  widespread  on  a  variety  of  minicomputers and early microcomputers during the 1970s. The now obsolete 8-inch and 5-Â¼ inch disks were made from  mylar  with  a  metal  oxide  coating   the  assembly  being housed in a flexible cardboard jacket (hence the term â€œfloppy diskâ€).   The  more  compact  3. 5-inch  diskettes  first  widely introduced  with  the  Apple macintosh  in  1984  became  the standard  type  for  all  PCs  by  the  1990s.   These  diskettes  are no longer truly â€œfloppyâ€ and come in a rigid plastic case.
