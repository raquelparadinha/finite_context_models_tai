267 The  role  of  the  computer  in  film  begins  well  before the  first  camera  rolls.   Writers  can  use  computers  to  write scripts   while  specialized  programs  can  be  used  to  lay out  storyboards.   Using  3D  programs  somewhat  like  CAD (drafting)  programs   set  designers  can  experiment  with the positioning of objects before deciding on a final design and  obtaining  or  creating  the  physical  props.   For  mattes (backgrounds  against  which  the  characters  will  be  shot  in a  scene)   a  computer-generated  scene  can  now  be  inserted directly  into  the  film  without  the  need  for  an  expensive  hand-painted backdrop.
