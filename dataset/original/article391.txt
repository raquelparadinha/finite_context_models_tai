390 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology was used by Gillette infield tests for tracking packets of razors through its supply chain.  Michelinplans to use vulcanizing to attach an RFID to a tire. Benetton is another clothing manufacturer that tested RFID tags in someproducts  such as  by weaving the technology into the collar tags of clothesthat cost at least $15 to keep track of them as they ship.  Benetton pulled backfrom this RFID trial after a consumer group announced a global boycott ofthe clothing manufacturer. The advantage of RFIDs over barcodes is that information can be collectedwithout a line of sight to the tag  hence  a pallet of goods or a razor can justbe scanned by passing through a radio field. With location tracking chips in mobile phones and toll payment cards thetechnology can always provide information about where the product and itsuser are currently located. This does not look good for data protection and Privacy and consumeradvocacy groups have complained loudly and continue fighting for citizenâ€™srights to privacy.
