392 Rijndael Algorithm was finally chosen as the winner because it was thefastest of them all.  The algorithm was broken shortly after its adoption byMike Boyle and Chris Salter as well as by Phillip Rogaway within daysof its publication as the accepted AES.  However  academic breaks are theones that force you to change things in the design process; practical breaksforce you to change things in fielded equipment.  This work is clearly of theacademic-break variety
