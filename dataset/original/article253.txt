252 There  are  a  number  of  ways  to  make  a  system  more  fault tolerant.  Individual components such as hard drives can be composed of multiple units so that the remaining units can take over if one fails  .  If each key component has at least one backup  then there should be time to replace the primary before the backup also fails. Another way to achieve fault tolerance is to provide mul-tiple paths to successful completion of the task.  In fact  this is  how  packet-switched  networks  like  the  Internet  work  .   If  one  communications  link  is  down  or  too congested  packets are given an alternative routing. Fault diagnosis software can also play an important role both in determining how to respond to a problem (beyond any automatic response) and for providing data that will be useful  later  to  system  administrators  or  technicians.   Some fault diagnosis systems can use elaborate rules   to pinpoint the cause of a fault and recommend a solution.
