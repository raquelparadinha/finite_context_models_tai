12 In the kind of science fiction sometimes called â€œcyberpunk â€people are able to â€œjack inâ€ or connect their brains directly tocomputer networks.  Because of this direct input into the brain(or perhaps the optic and other sensory nerves)  a personwho is jacked in experiences the virtual world as fully real and can (depending on the worldâ€™s rules) manipulate it withhis or her mind.  This kind of all-immersive virtual reality isstill science fiction  but today people are beginning to controlcomputers and artificial limbs directly with their minds.
