238 gIF  or graphics Interchange Format  is a bitmapped format promulgated  by  CompuServe.   Instead  of  reserving  enough space  to  store  a  large  number  of  colors  in  each  pixel   this format  uses  a  color  table  that  can  hold  up  to  256  colors.  Each pixel contains a reference (index into) the color table.  This means that gIF works best with images that have rela-tively  few  colors  and  for  applications  (such  as  Web  pages) where compactness  is  important.  gIF  also  uses  compres-sion to achieve compactness  but unlike the case with JPEg it is a lossless compression called LZW.  There is also a gIF format that stores simple animations.
