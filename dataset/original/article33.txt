32 According to Stallman and many other advocates  â€œopensourceâ€ software is not necessarily free.  What is requiredis that users receive the full source code (or have it readilyavailable for free or at nominal charge).  Users are free tomodify or expand the source code to create and distributenew versions of the software.  Following a legal mechanismthat Stallman calls â€œcopyleft â€ the distributor of opensource software must allow subsequent recipients the samefreedom to revise and redistribute.  However  not all software that is billed as open source follows all of Stallmanâ€™srequirements  including being copylefted.  Formally  opensource software is generally licensed according to variousversions of the General Public License (GPL).  The latestversion  GPL3  released in 2007  has been controversial. Among other things  it more aggressively attempts to prevent open-source software from being restricted or otherwise hampered by being combined with patented softwareor proprietary hardware.
