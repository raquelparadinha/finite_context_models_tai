49 The PHP processor parses only the code within the delimiters <? and ?>.  (An alternative set of delimiters is <script language =â€˜phpâ€™> </script>. Besides being embedded in HTML pages  PHP can be used interactively at the command line  where it has replaced older languages such as awk  Perl  or shell scripting for many users.  PHP can also be linked to user-interface libraries (such as GTK+ for Linux/UNIX) to create applications that run on the client machine rather than the server. PHP has a basic set of data types plus one called â€œresourceâ€ that represents data processed by special functions that return images  text files  database records  and so on.  Additionally  PHP5 provides full support for objects  including private and protected member variables  constructors and destructors  and other features similar to those found in C++ and other languages. There are numerous libraries of open-source objects and functions that enable PHP scripts to perform common Internet tasks  including accessing database servers (such as MySQL) as well as extensions to the language to handle popular Web formats such as Adobe Flash animation.  Programmers have access to a wide range of PHP resources through PEAR (the PHP Extension and Application Repository). The combination of sophisticated features and easy interactive scripting has made PHP the language of choice for many Web developers  who use it as part of the group of technologies called LAMP  for Linux  Apache (Web server)  MySQL (database)  and PHP.
