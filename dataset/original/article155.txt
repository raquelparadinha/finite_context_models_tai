154 When videotape first became available in the 1950s  recorders cost thousands of dollars and could only be afforded by TV studios.  Today the VCR is inexpensive and ubiquitous.  However  it is hard to edit videotape.  Tape is a linear medium  meaning that to find a given piece of video the tape has to be moved to that spot.  Removing or adding something involves either physically splicing the tape (as is done with film) or more commonly  feeding in tape from two or more recorders onto a destination tape.  Besides being tedious and limited in capabilities  â€œlinear editingâ€ by copying loses a bit of quality with each copying operation. Today  however  it is easy to shoot video in digital form   or to convert analog video into digital form.  Digital video is a stream of data that represents sampling of the source signal  such as from the chargecoupled device (CCD) that turns light photons into electron flow in a digital camera or digital camcorder.  This process involves either software or hardware compression for storage and decompression for viewing and editing (such a scheme is called a CODEC for â€œcompression/decompressionâ€).  The most widely used formats include DV (Digital Video) and MPEG (Motion Picture Expert Group)  which has versions that vary in the amount of compression and thus fidelity
