102 Originally standing for Simple Object Access Protocol  but now no longer an acronym  SOAP is a standard way to access Web services  .  In todayâ€™s Web  where what appears to users to be a single site or application is usually built from many services  such a facility is essential. Prior to SOAP  Web applications usually communicated through remote procedure calls (RPC).  However there were problems with compatibility of applications running under different operating systems (and perhaps using different programming languages)  as well as security problems that often led to such facilities being blocked. SOAP  on the other hand  uses the same HTTP recognized by all Web servers and browsers  â€”indeed  it can also use secure HTTP (https). A SOAP request (or message) is an ordinary XML file   that includes an â€œenvelopeâ€ element specifying it to be a SOAP message  an optional header  a body element containing the information pertaining to the function or transaction requested  and an optional fault element to specify error processing.  After receiving the message  the destination server returns a message providing the requested information.
