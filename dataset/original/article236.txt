235 In  a  bitmap  format  there  is  a  group  of  bits  (i. e.   a  binary value)  that  specifies  the  color  of  each  pixel.   Windows  pro-vides standard  bitmap  (BmP)  formats  for  1-bit  (2  colors or  monochrome)   4-bit  (16  colors)   8-bit  (256  colors)   or 24-bit  (16  million  colors).   The  Windows  bitmap  format  is also  called  a  DIB  (device-independent  bitmap)  because  the stored  colors  are  independent  of  the  output  device  to  be used  (such  as  a  monitor  or  printer).   The  relevant  device driver is responsible for translating the color to one actually used by the device.  Because it is â€œnativeâ€ to Windows  BmP is widely used  especially for program graphics resources.
