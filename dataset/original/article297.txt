296 In the early 1950s  knowledge of computing tended to have and hoc nature.  On the practical level  computing staffs tended to train newcomers in the specific hardware and machine-level programming languages in use at a particular site.  On the theoretical level  programmers in scientific fields were likely to come from a background in electronics  electrical engineering  or similar disciplines. As it became clear that computers were going to play an increasingly important role  courses specific to computing were added to curricula in mathematics and engineering.  By the late 1950s  however  leading people in the computing field had become convinced that a formal curriculum in computer science was necessary for further advance in an increasingly sophisticated computing arena .  By the early 1960s  efforts at the University of Michigan  University of Houston  Stanford  and other institutions had resulted in the creation of separate graduate departments of computer science.  By the mid-1960s  the National Academy of Sciences and the Presidentâ€™s Science Advisory Committee had both called for a major expansion of efforts in computer science education to be aided by federal funding.  During the 1970s and 1980s  mathematical and engineering societies (in particular the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IEEE) worked to established detailed computer science curricula that extended to undergraduate study.  By 2000  there were 155 accredited  programs in computer science in the United States.
