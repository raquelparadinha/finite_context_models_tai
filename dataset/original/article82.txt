81 In order for a computer to work with information  the information must be digitizedâ€”converted to data that application programs can recognize and manipulate  .  Computer users have thus been confronted with the task of converting millions of pages of printed words or graphics into machine-readable form.  Since it is expensive to re-key text (and impractical to redraw images)  some way is needed to automatically convert the varying shades or colors of the text or images into a digitized graphics image that can be stored in a file. This is what a scanner does.  The scanner head contains a charge-coupled device (CCD) like that used in digital cameras  .  The CCD contains thousands or millions of tiny regions that can convert incoming light into a voltage level.  Each of these voltage levels  when amplified  will correspond to one pixel of the scanned image.  (A color scanner uses three different diodes for each pixel  each receiving light through a red  green  or blue filter. )
