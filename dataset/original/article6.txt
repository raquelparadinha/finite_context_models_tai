5 By the late 1970s  researchers at many major universities were using the UNIX operating system  .  In 1979  a suite of utilities called UUCP was distributed with the widely used UNIX Version 7.  These utilities could be used to transfer files between UNIX computers that were linked by some form of telephone or network connection. Two Duke University graduate students  Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis  decided to set up a way in which users on different computers could share a collection of files containing text messages on various topics.  They wrote a simple set of shell scripts that could be used for distributing and viewing these message files.  The first version of the news network linked computers at Duke and at the University of North Carolina.  Soon these programs were revised and rewritten in the C language and distributed to other UNIX users as the â€œAâ€ release of the News software. During the 1980s  the news system was expanded and features such as moderated newsgroups were added.  As the Internet and its TCP/IP protocol   became a more widespread standard for connecting computers  a version of News using the NNTP (Network News Transmission Protocol) over the Internet was released in 1986.  Netnews is a mature system today  with news reading software available for virtually every type of computer
