461 The Document Object Model (DOM) is a way to represent a Web document   as an object that can be manipulated using code in a scripting language  .  The DOM was created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as a way to standardize methods of manipulating Web pages at a time when different browsers used different access models.  The full specification is divided into four levels (0 through 3).  By 2005  most DOMspecifications were supported by the major Web browsers. Using DOM  a programmer can navigate through the hierarchical structure of a document  following links or â€œdescendingâ€ into forms and user-interface objects.  With DOM one can also add HTML or XML elements  as well as load  save  or format documents.
