460 The operation of the Internet requires that each participating computer have a unique address to which data packets can be routed  .  The Domain Name System (DNS) provides alphabetical equivalents to the numeric IP addresses  giving the now familiar-looking Web addresses (URLs)  e-mail addresses  and so on. The system uses a set of â€œtop-levelâ€ domains to categorize these names.  One set of domains is based on the nature of the sites involved  including: . com (commercial  corporate)  . edu (educational institutions)  . gov (government)  . mil (military)  . org (nonprofit organizations)  . int (international organizations)  . net (network service providers  and so on). The other set of top-level domains is based on the geographical location of the site.  For example  . au (Australia)  . fr (France)  and . ca (Canada).  (While the United States has the . us domain  it is generally omitted in practice  because the Internet was developed in the United States)
