474 Much future progress in car computing will depend on creating integrated networking between vehicles and the road.  An advanced navigation system could take advantage of real-time information being transmitted by the surrounding vehicles.  For example  a stalled car would transmit warning messages to other drivers about the impending obstacle.  Vehicles that sense an oil slick  ice  or other road hazard could also â€œmarkâ€ the location so it can be avoided by subsequent drivers.  Data about the speed and spacing of traffic could provide real-time information about traffic jams  possibly routing vehicles into alternative lanes or other roads to reduce congestion and travel time
