207 Information theory is the study of the fundamental charac-teristics of information and its transmission and reception.  As  a  discipline   information  theory  took  its  impetus  from the ideas of Claude Shannon  . In  his  seminal  paper  â€œA mathematical  Theory  of  Com-municationâ€  published  in  the Bell  System  Technical  Journalin 1948  Shannon analyzed the redundancy inherent in any form  of  communication  other  than  a  series  of  purely  ran-dom  numbers.   Because  of  this  redundancy   the  amount  of information  (expressed  in  binary  bits)  needed  to  convey  a message  will  be  less  than  the  number  in  the  original  mes-sage.   It  is  because  of  redundancy  that  data  compression algorithms can be applied to text  graphics  and other types of  files  to  be  stored  on  disk  or  transmitted  over  a  network
