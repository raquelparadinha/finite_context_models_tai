344 Digital Signature uses public-key algorithm to generate a digital signature which is a block of data used to create some authentication  .  When a judge sees a digital signature  he or she does not knowanything about the signatoryâ€™s intentions.  He doesnâ€™t know if the personagreed to the document as one being presented with a notarized signature. Nor do we know if the signatory ever saw the signed document.  The problemis that:while a digital signature authenticates the document up to the point of the signingcomputer it does not authenticate the link between that computer and the individual. Digital signatures prove  mathematically  that a secret value known as theprivate key was present in a computer at the time the personâ€™s signature wascalculated.  It is a small step from that inferring that the individual enteredthat key into the computer at the time of signing.  But it is a much largerstep to assume that the individual actually intended a particular documentto be signed.  And without a tamperproof computer trusted by the signingindividual  one can expect â€œdigital signature expertsâ€ to show up in courtcontesting a lot of digital signatures.
