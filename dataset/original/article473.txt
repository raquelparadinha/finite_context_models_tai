472 The final stage in the development of the calculator would be characterized by the use of electronics to replace mechanical (or electromechanical) action.  The use of logic 70? ? ? ? calculatorcircuits to perform calculations electronically was first seen in the giant computers of the late 1940s  but this was obviously impractical for desktop office use.  By the late 1960s  however  transistorized calculators comparable in size to mechanical desktop calculators came into use.  By the 1970s  the use of integrated circuits made it possible to shrink the calculator down to palm-size and smaller.  These calculators use a microprocessor with a set of â€œmicroinstructionsâ€ that enable them to perform a repertoire of operations ranging from basic arithmetic to trigonometric  statistical  or business-related function
