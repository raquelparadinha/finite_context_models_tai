503 CMYK stands for cyan  magenta  yellow  and black.  This four component color system is standard for most types of color printing  since black is an ink color in printing but is simply the absence of color in video.  One of the more difficult tasks to be performed by desktop publishing software is to properly match a given RGB screen color to the corresponding CMYK print color.  Recent versions of Microsoft Windows and the Macintosh operating system include a CMS (color matching system) to support color matching.
