258 The file system is the facility of the operating system that organizes files  .  For example  on DOS and older Windows PCs  there is a file allocation table (FAT) that consists of a linked list of clusters (each cluster consists of a fixed number of sectors  varying with the overall size of the disk).  When the operating system is asked to access a file  it can go through the table and find the clusters belonging to that file  read the data and send it to the requesting applica-tio n.   modern  file  systems  further  organize  files  into  groups called folders or directories  which can be nested several lay-ers  deep.   Such  a  hierarchical  file  system  makes  it  easier  for users to organize the dozens of applications and thousands of files found on todayâ€™s PCs.  For example  a folder called Book might have a subfolder for each chapter  which in turn con-tains folders for text and illustrations relating to that chapter.
