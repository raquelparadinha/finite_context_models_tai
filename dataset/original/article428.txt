427 One advantage of using abstract data types is that it separates a structure and functionality from its implementation.  In designing the abstract stack type  for example  one can focus on what a stack does and its essential functions.  One avoids becoming immediately bogged down with details  such as what sorts of data items can be placed on the stack  or exactly what mechanism will be used to keep track of the number of items currently stored.  This approach also avoids â€œfeaturitis â€ the tendency to see how many possible functions or features one can add to the stack object.  For example  while it might be useful to give a stack the ability to print out a list of its items  it is probably better to wait until one needs such a capability than to burden the basic stack idea with extra baggage that may make it more cumbersome or less efficient.
