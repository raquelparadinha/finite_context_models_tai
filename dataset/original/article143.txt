142 Although they use different devices and formats  text messaging on cell phones and PDAs and instant messaging through online services have much in common.  Both involve sending short messages to other users who can receive them and reply as soon as they are online.  (This is an ad hoc connection that differs from a chat room [see chat  online] in that the latter is an established location where people go to converse with other members.  It also differs from an online discussion group [see conferencing systems and netnews and newsgroups] where messages are posted and may be replied to later  but there is no real-time communication. )Text messaging or texting uses a protocol called Short Message Service (SMS)  which is available with most cell phones and service plans as well as PDAs that have wireless connections.  When a user sends a message to a designated recipient  it goes to a service center where it is routed to the destination phone; if that phone is not connected  the message is stored and retried later.  Typically messages are limited to 160 characters  though up to six or so messages can be concatenated and treated as a longer message. While texting did not become popular until the late 1990s  instant messaging began in the 1970s as a way for multiple users on a shared computer or network (such as a UNIX system) to communicate in real time using commands such as send and talk (the latter being more conversationalâ€”see chat  online).  In the late 1980s and early 1990s  various dial-up services   provided for sending text messages (AOL was the first to use the term instant messages for its facility).  By the mid-1990s instant messaging was well established on the Internet  often employing a graphical user interface  as with ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger (AOL later acquired ICQ as well).
