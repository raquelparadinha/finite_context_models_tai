99 The smart card is the next generation of transaction devices.  Magnetically coded credit  debit  and ATM cards have been in use for many years.  These cards contain a magnetic strip encoded with a small amount of fixed data to identify the account.  All the actual data (such as account balances) is kept in a central server  which is why credit cards must be validated and transactions approved through a phone (modem) link.  Some magnetic strip cards such as those used in rapid transit systems are rewritable  so that  for example  the fare for the current ride can be deducted.  Telephone cards work the same way.  Nevertheless  these cards are essentially passive tokens containing a small amount of data.  They have little flexibility. However  since the mid-1970s it has been possible to put a microprocessor and rewritable memory into a card the size of a standard credit card.  These smart cards can store a hundred or more times the data of a magnetic strip card.  Further  because they have an onboard computer    they can interact with a computer at the point of service  exchanging and updating information
