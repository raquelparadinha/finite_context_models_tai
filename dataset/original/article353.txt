352 eMail or Electronic Mail is an electronically transmitted message which arrives as a computer file on a userâ€™s PC or the corporationâ€™s server.  Originallyconceived as a simple means of sending short messages from one computer toanother  the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) was introduced withoutsecurity in mind. Whilst standards have been agreed for the attachment of files to eMailmessages  be aware that such files can contain Malicious Code such as a Virus. eMail is insecure because:Message can purport to have been sent from an individual  whilst it was sentfrom somebody else  possible misrepresentation;The From field may have been modified to indicate a sender that is fallacious ordoes not exist;Because there is no Authentication  the eMail can be opened by anyone unlessit is encrypted  ;When sending eMail  the sender has no guarantee that the recipient has receivedit after passing through multiple computer nodes to get to the final destination  hence  without requesting safe receipt there is little guarantee  ; andeMail is not a legal document unless sent using a digital signature but by 2002 EU member states and the USA (some states) have begun accepting documents withDigital Signatures as legally binding documents
