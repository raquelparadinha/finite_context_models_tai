97 Simulations and simulation techniques are used for a tremendous range of applications today.  Besides helping with the understanding of natural systems in physics  chemistry  biology  or engineering  simulation techniques are also applied to human behavior.  For example  the behavior of consumers or traders in a stock market can be explored with a simulation based on game theory concepts.  Artificial intelligence techniques (such as expert systems) can be used to give the individual â€œactorsâ€ in a simulation more realistic behavior. Simulations are often used in training.  A modern flight simulator  for example  not only simulates the aerodynamics of a plane and its response to the environment and to control inputs  but detailed graphics (and simulated physical motion) can make such training simulations feel very realistic  if not quite to Star Trek holodeck standards.  Whether for flight  military exercises  or stock trading  simulations can provide a much wider range of experiences in a relatively short time than would be feasible (or safe) using the real-world activity.  Simulations can also play an important part in testing software or systems or in predicating the results of business decisions or strategies. Simulations are also frequently sold as entertainment.  Many commercial strategy and role-playing games as well as vehicle simulators contain surprisingly complex simulations that make the games both absorbing and challenging  .  Such games can also have considerable educational value.
