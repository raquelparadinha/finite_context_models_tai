417 The use of encryption to disguise the meanings of messages goes back thousands of years (the Romans  for example  used substitution ciphers  where each letter in a message was replaced with a different letter).  Mechanical cipher machines first came into general use in the 1930s.  During World War II the German Enigma cipher machine used multiple rotors and a configurable plugboard to create a continuously varying cipher that was thought to be unbreakable.  However  Allied codebreakers built electromechanical and electronic devices that succeeded in exploiting flaws in the German machine (while incidentally advancing computing technology).  During the cold war Western and Soviet cryptographers vied to create increasingly complex cryptosystems while deploying more powerful computers to decrypt their opponentâ€™s messages.
