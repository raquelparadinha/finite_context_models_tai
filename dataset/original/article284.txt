283 Forth  has  a  very  simple  structure.   The  Forth  system  con-sists  of  a  collection  of words.   Each  word  is  a  sequence  of operations  (which  can  include  other  existing  words).   For example  the DUP word makes a copy of a data value.  Data is  held  by  a  stack.   For  example   the  arithmetic  expression written  as  2  +  3  in  most  languages  would  be  written  in Forth  as  +  2  3.   When  the  +  operator  (which  in  Forth  is  a pre-defined  word)  executes   it  adds  the  next  two  numbers it  encounters  (2  and  3)  together   and  puts  the  sum  on  the stack (where in turn it might be fetched for further process-ing by the next word in the program  .  This rep-resentation  is  also  called postfix  notation  and  is  familiar  to many users of scientific calculators.
