393 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) means that access decisions are basedon the roles the user has as part of tasks to be performed  . The central notion of RBAC is that users do not have discretionary access to enterprise objects.  Instead  access permissions are administrativelyassociated with roles  and users are administratively made members of appropriate roles.  This idea greatly simplifies management of authorizationwhile providing an opportunity for great flexibility in specifying and enforcing enterprise- specific protection policies.  Users can be made members ofroles as determined by their responsibilities and qualifications and can beeasily reassigned from one role to another without modifying the underlyingaccess structure.  Roles can be granted new permissions as new applicationsand actions are incorporated  and permissions can be revoked from roles asneeded.
