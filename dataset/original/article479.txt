478 Once a program has been designed and implementation is under way  CASE tools can help the programmers maintain consistency across their various modules.  One such tool (now rather venerable) is the data dictionary  which is a database whose records contain information about the definition of data items and a list of program components that use each item  .  When the definition of a data item is changed  the data dictionary can provide a list of affected components.  Database technology is also applied to software design in the creation of a database of objects within a particular program  which can be used to provide more extensive information during debugging.
