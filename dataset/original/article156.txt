155  A little later  bulletin boards and especially systems such as the WELL (Whole Earth â€™Lectronic Link) based in the San Francisco Bay Area   provided long-term outlets for people to share information and interact on-line. Looking at the WELL  a writer named Howard Rheingold introduced the term virtual community in a 1993 book.  He explored the ways in which a sufficiently compelling and versatile technology encouraged people to form long-term contacts  form personal relationships  and carry out feuds.  When on-line  participants experience such a venue as the WELL as a place that becomes almost as tangible (and often as â€œrealâ€) as a physical place such as a small town or corner bar. Virtual community members who live in the same geographical area sometimes do get together physically (the WELL has had picniclike â€œWELL Office Partiesâ€ for many years).  Members can band together to support a colleague who faces a crisis such as the life-threatening illness of a son (on the WELL  blank postings called beams are often used as an expression of sympathy).  The virtual community can also serve as a rallying point following a physical disaster such as the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area.  On a daily basis  virtual communities can often provide help or advice from a remarkable variety of highly qualified experts.
