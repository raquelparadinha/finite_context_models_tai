266 Once the programs agree on the basic parameters for a file transfer   the  transfer  has  to  be  managed  to  ensure  that  it completes  correctly.   Typically   files  are  divided  into  blocks of data (such as 1K  or 1024 bytes each).  During the 1970s  Ward Christensen developed xmodem  the first widely used file transfer program for PCs running CP/m (and later  mS-DOS and other operating systems).  xmodem was quite reli-able because it incorporated a checksum (and later  a more advanced  CRC)  to  check  the  integrity  of  each  data  block.  If  an  error  is  detected   the  receiving  program  requests  a retransmission.
