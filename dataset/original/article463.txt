462 DSL (digital subscriber line) is one of the two most prevalent forms of high-speed wired access to the Internet  .  DSL can operate over regular phone lines (sometimes called POTS or â€œplain old telephone serviceâ€).  DSL takes advantage of the fact that existing phone lines can carry frequencies far beyond the narrow band used for voice telephony.  When installing DSL  the phone company must evaluate the quality of existing lines to determine how many frequency bands are usable  and thus how much data can be transmitted.  Further  because the higher the frequency the shorter the distance the signal can travel  the available bandwidth drops as one gets farther from the central office or a local DSL access Multiplexer (DSLAM)
