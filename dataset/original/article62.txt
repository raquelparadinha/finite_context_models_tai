61 The Internet and its perception as a shared cyberspace adds new dimensions to the psychology of computing.  In fact  the emphasis here is not on computation per se but on the representation of ideas and images  communication  social interaction  and identity.  In particular  pioneering work   has illuminated ways in which online interactions affect identity and sense of selfâ€”even encouraging the assumption of multiple identities  .  Indeed  virtual worlds such as Second Life offer new ways to study the formation of communities and social interactions. On the positive side  it has been argued that cyberspace has encouraged people (particularly adolescents) to experiment with new identities in a relatively safe environment  but lack of inhibition and experience can lead to risky behavior such as involvement with sexual predators.  The very fact that many people (particularly the young) may spend several hours a day or more immersed in the online world has also led to concerns; some psychologists have even suggested that â€œInternet addiction disorderâ€ (IAD) be included as an official mental disorder similar to compulsive gambling.  However  as of 2007  the American Medical Association has not recommended that IAD be classified as a mental disorder  and the American Society of Addiction Medicine has resisted such a status.  Generally  excessive or inappropriate use of the Internet has been seen as a symptom of more traditional diagnoses such as obsession or compulsion.
