171 Wiki software varies in details such as use of markup languages  programming interface  and platform.  However  most wikis include the following features:  Users can create new pages (articles) or edit existing ones.   Pages contain links to related pages  sometimes using â€œwiki wordsâ€ where WordsAreScrunchedTogetherWithIntialCaps.   Simple markup can be used to create such effects as boldface  headings  or lists.  The wiki software usually translates this to HTML for rendering.   A record is kept of each contribution or edit  often displayed on a â€œRecent Changesâ€ page.  ? Many wikis use a database (such as MySQL) to store and retrieve pages.  Some wikis simply store each page as a file  and a few (such as TiddlyWiki) store all pages together as a single document.   Wikis can be public (open to anyone) or restricted  such as to members of an organization.   The administrator of the wiki establishes guidelines or standards (such as for citing sources for facts) and procedures for dealing with disputes and controversial topics
