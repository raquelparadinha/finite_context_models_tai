248 grid  and  cluster  architectures  often  overlap   but  the  term grid  tends  to  be  applied  to  a  more  loosely  coordinated structure  where  the  computers  are  dispersed  over  a  wider area  (not  a  local  network).   In  a  grid   the  work  is  usually divided  into  many  separate  packets  that  can  be  processed independently without the computers having to share data.  Each task can be completed and submitted without waiting for the completion of any other task.  Clusters  or the other hand   more  closely  couple  computers  to  act  more  like  a single large machine.
