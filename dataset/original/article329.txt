328 checksum is a mathematical method whereby the individual binary values ofa string of storage locations on a computerâ€™s hard drive are summed up  andthe total is then retained for future reference.  On subsequent accesses  thesumming procedure is repeated  and the total compared to the one derivedpreviously. A difference indicates that an element of stored data has changed duringthe intervening period.  Agreement provides a high degree of assurance (butnot total assurance) that data have not been changed during the interveningperiod. A checksum is also used to verify that a network transmission has beensuccessful.  If the counts agree  it is safe to assume that the transmission wascompleted correctly  .
