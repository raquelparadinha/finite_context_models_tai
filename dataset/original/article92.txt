91 A growing number of people 50 and older have been learning how to use computer technology and especially applications such as e-mail and Web browsing.  However  a substantial number of seniors have expressed reluctance to join the digital worldâ€”as of January 2006  the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that only 34 percent of persons 65 and over were online.  Some reasons why seniors have avoided the technology include the following:  the belief that it would be too hard to learn to use it  uncertainty about what can be done online and whether it is worth the effort  fear of well-publicized dangers such as viruses and identity theft  the expense of a personal computer and Internet accessFortunately a number of these factors are gradually being ameliorated.  There are numerous books and courses (such as at adult education or senior centers) that introduce the essentials of computing to seniors.  Properly installed security and filtering software  together with some user education  can minimize the chances of being victimized online.  Finally  Internet-capable PCs are now available for around $300 or less  though the cost of broadband access has not fallen as rapidly as that of hardware.
