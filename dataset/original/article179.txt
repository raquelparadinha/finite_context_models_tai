However  Yahoo! proved its resilience as one of the fewearly dot-coms to survive and has continued to thrive inthe post-bubble era since 2002.  The company made strate-gic partnerships with telecommunications companies suchas BT and Verizon.  Yahoo! entered a continuing strugglewith another Web services powerhouse   whileacquiring new media sites (such as the photo-sharing ser-vice Flickr and the social â€œbookmarkingâ€ service del. icio. us)  and creating new services  .
