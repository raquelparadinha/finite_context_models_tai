14 As more is learned about the detailed functioning of neuronal networks inside the brain  â€œcognitive prostheticsâ€ maybecome feasible.  One example might be computer memory modules that might act as a surrogate or extension ofhuman memory  perhaps helping compensate for loss ofmemory due to age or disease.  (Early experiments on interfacing to the hippocampus  a part of the brain important forforming memories  have been underway since 2003. )Other possibilities might include processors that couldgive a person the ability to think about a mathematicalproblem and â€œseeâ€ the answer  or to search databases or theWeb simply by visualizing or thinking about the information desired
