96 A simulation is a simplified (but adequate) model that represents how a system works.  The system can be an existing  real-world one  such as a stock market or a human heart  or a proposed design for a system  such as a new factory or even a space colony. If a system is simple enough (a cannonball falling from a height  for example)  it is possible to use formulas such as those provided by Newton to get an exact answer.  However  many real-world systems involve many discrete entities with complex interactions that cannot be captured with a single equation.  During the 1940s  scientists encountered just this problem in attempting to understand what would happen under various conditions in a nuclear reaction. Together with physicist Enrico Fermi  two mathematicians  John von Neumann   and Stanislaw Ulam  devised a new way to simulate complex systems.  Instead of trying fruitlessly to come up with some huge formula to â€œsolveâ€ the whole system  they applied probability formulas to each of a number of particlesâ€”in effect  â€œrolling the diceâ€ for each one and then observing their resulting distribution and behavior.  Because of its analogy to gambling  this became known as the Monte Carlo method.  It turned out to be widely useful not only for simulating nuclear reactions and particle physics but for many other activities (such as bombing raids or the spread of disease) where many separate things behave according to probabilities.
