237 EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) is a vector-based rather than bitmap (raster) format.  This means that an EPS file consists not  of  the  actual  pixel  values  of  an  image   but  the  instruc-tions for drawing the image (including coordinates  colors  and  so  on).   The  instructions  are  specified  as  a  text  file  in the versatile PostScript page description language.  This for-mat is usually used for printing  and requires a printer that supports PostScript (there are also PostScript renderers that run entirely in software  but they tend to be slow and some-what unreliable).
