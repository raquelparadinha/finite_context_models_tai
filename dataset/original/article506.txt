505 Portability is the ability to adapt software or hardware to a wide variety of platforms (that is  computer systems or operating systems).  Developers want their products to be portable so they can adapt to an often rapidly changing marketplace.  A typical strategy for portability is to choose a language that is in widespread use and a compiler that is certified as meeting the ANSI or other standard for the language.  The program should be written in such a way that it makes as few assumptions as possible about hardwaredependent matters such as how data is stored in memory.  It is also sometimes possible to use standard frameworks that provide the same functions in several different operating systems such as Windows  Macintosh  and UNIX.
