415 One consequence of the universal computer concept   is that in principle any computer can be programmed to imitate the operation of any other.  An emulator is a program that runs on one computer but accurately processes instructions written for another  .  For example  fans of older computer games can now download emulation programs that allow modern PCs to run games originally intended for an Apple II microcomputer or an Atari game machine.  Emulators allowing Macintosh and Linux users to run Windows programs have also achieved some success. In order to work properly  the emulator must set up a sort of virtual model of the target microprocessor  including appropriate registers to hold data and instructions and a suitably organized segment of memory.  While carrying out instructions in software rather than in hardware imposes a considerable speed penalty  if the processor of the emulating PC is much faster than the one being emulated  the emulator can actually run faster than the original machine.
