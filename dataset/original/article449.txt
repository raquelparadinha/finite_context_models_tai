448 The unusual computing term demon (sometimes spelled daemon) refers to a process (program) that runs in the background  checking for and responding to certain events.  The utility of this concept is that it allows for automation of information processing without requiring that an operator initiate or manage the process. For example  a print spooler demon looks for jobs that are queued for printing  and deals with the negotiations necessary to maintain the flow of data to that device.  Another demon (called chron in UNIX systems) reads a file describing processes that are designated to run at particular dates or times.  For example  it may launch a backup utility every morning at 1:00 a. m.  E-mail also depends on the periodic operation of â€œmailer demons. â€
