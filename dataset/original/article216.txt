215 The  two  major  application  areas  for  hashing  are  informa-tion  retrieval  and  cryptographic  certification.   In  databases  an index table can be built that contains the hash values for the key fields and the corresponding record number for each field   with  the  entries  in  hash  value  order.   To  search  the database  an input key is hashed and the value is compared with  the  index  table  (which  can  be  done  using  a  very  fast binary search).  If the hash value is found  the corresponding record number is used to look up the record.  This tends to be much faster than searching an index file directly.
