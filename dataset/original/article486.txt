485 While the attention of the first computer designers focused mainly on numeric calculations  it was clear that much of the data that business people and others would want to manipulate with the new machines would be textual in nature.  Billing records  for example  would have to include customer names and addresses  not just balance totals. The â€œnaturalâ€ representation of data in a computer is as a series of two-state (binary) values  interpreted as binary numbers.  The solution for representing text (letters of the alphabet  punctuation marks  and other special symbols) is to assign a numeric value to each text symbol.  The result is a character code  such as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)  which is the scheme used most widely today.  (Another system  EBCDIC (Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code) was used during the heyday of IBM mainframes  but is seldom used today.
