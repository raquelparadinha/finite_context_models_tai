213 In  the  early  days  of  computing   the  programmers  of  a  sys-tem  tended  to  also  be  its  users  and  were  thus  intimately familiar  with  the  programâ€™s  operation  and  command  set.  To search a hashed database  the hashing formula is first applied to the search key  yielding a hash value.  That value can then be used in a binary search to quickly zero in on the matching record  if any.         health  personalIf not a programmer  the user of a mainframe program was probably  at  least  a  well-trained  operator  who  could  work with  the  aid  of  a  brief  summary  or  notes  provided  by  the programmer.   However   with  the  beginnings  of  office  auto-mation  in  the  1970s  and  the  growing  use  of  desktop  com-puters in office  home  and school in the 1980s  increasingly complex  programs  were  being  put  in  the  hands  of  users who  often  had  only  minimal  computer  training   . While  programs  often  came  with  one  or  more  tutorial or  reference  manuals   designers  realized  that  offering  help through  the  program  itself  would  have  some  clear  advan-tages.  First  the user would not have to switch attention from the computer screen to look things up in a manual.  Second  the  help  system  could  be  programmed  to  not  only  provide information   but  also  to  help  the  user  find  the  informa-tion needed in a given situation.  For example  related topics could be linked together and a searchable index provided
