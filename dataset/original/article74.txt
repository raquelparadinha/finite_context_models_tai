73 Web sites such as news providers and blogs   are constantly posting new material.  While readers can periodically visit a site to look for new material  an increasingly popular option is to subscribe to a â€œWeb feedâ€ and receive the latest information automatically.  The most commonly used tool for Web feeds is RSS  which can stand for Really Simple Syndication  Rich Site Summary  or RDF Site Summary  depending on the format used. The data in an RSS feed can include article titles  summaries  excerpts (such as the first paragraph)  or the complete article or posting.  Feeds can also include multimedia such as graphics  video  or sound.  The data (and any linked material) is formatted using standard markup elements  .  As part of the process of setting up a feed on the Web server  the feed is â€œpublishedâ€ so that it can be found and read using a client program called a reader or aggregator (the latter can combine feeds or organize them in a newspaper-like format for convenience).  RSS readers can be stand-alone applications or be included with many modern Web browsers and e-mail clients.  Alternatively  Webbased readers or aggregators such as NewsGator Online can allow feeds to be read using any Web browser.  Readers of Web pages can find RSS feeds by looking for a â€œsubscribeâ€ icon or the words RSS or XML.  Specialized search engines such as Bloglines can also help users find interesting feeds.  Additionally  information on the server can also be used by software to automatically deliver the latest content
