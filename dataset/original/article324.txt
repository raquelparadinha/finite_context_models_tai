323 Disk Cache is a temporary storage place that a computer can use to storea file after reading it from the hard drive.  For instanceâ€š telling a computerto open a MP3 fileâ€š it may take several seconds for it to locate and read thefile into memory from the PCs hard drive.  Howeverâ€š if the computer storesthe file in the Disk Cacheâ€š the next time one wishes to open the same fileâ€šdata can be retrieved from the disk cache rather than loading it from the harddrive. One definition refers to a Disk Cache specifically as: hard disk-based memory used to store accessed web pages.  This technique enables the browserload the stored pages from the cache rather than from the network.  That iswhy clicking the â€˜Backâ€™ button on a browser usually retrieves a page nearlyinstantaneously.  The virtual memory system that comes with Microsoft Windows is also another example of disk caching to increase performance
