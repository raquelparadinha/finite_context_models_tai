407 Eiffel is an interesting programming language developed by Bertrand Meyer and his company Eiffel Software in the 1980s.  The language was named for Gustav Eiffel  the architect who designed the famous tower in Paris.  The language and accompanying methodology attracted considerable interest at software engineering conferences. Eiffel fully supports (and in some ways pioneered) programming concepts found in more widely used languages today  .  Syntactically  Eiffel emphasizes simple  reusable declarations that make the program easier to understand  and tries to avoid obscure or lower-level code such as compiler optimizations.
