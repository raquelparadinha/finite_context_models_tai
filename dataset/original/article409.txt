408 Eiffelâ€™s proponents note that it is more than a language: It is designed to provide consistent ways to revise and reuse program components throughout the software development cycle.  The current implementation of Eiffel is available for virtually all platforms and has interfaces to C  C++  and other languages.  This allows Eiffel to be used to create a design framework for reusing existing software components in other languages.  Eiffelâ€™s consistent object-oriented design also makes it useful for documenting or modeling software projects
