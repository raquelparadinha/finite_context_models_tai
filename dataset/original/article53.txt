52 A number of applications programs include the ability for third-party developers to write small programs that extend the main programâ€™s functionality.  For example  thousands of â€œfiltersâ€ (algorithms for transforming images) have been written for Adobe Photoshop.  These small programs are called plug-ins because they are designed to connect to the main program and provide their service whenever it is desired or required. Perhaps the most commonly encountered plug-ins are those available for Web browsers such as Firefox  Netscape  or Internet Explorer.  Plug-ins can enable the browser to display new types of files (such as multimedia).  Many standard programs for particular kinds of files are now provided both as stand-alone applications and as browser plug-ins.  Examples include Adobe (PDF document format)  Apple QuickTime (graphics  video  and animation)  RealPlayer (streaming video and audio)  and Macromedia Flash (interactive animation and presentation).  These and many other plug-ins are offered free for the downloading  in order to increase the number of potential users for the formats and thus the market for the development packages. One of the most useful plug-ins found in most browsers is one that allows the browser to run Java applets  .  In turn  Java is often used to write other plug-ins. Beyond such traditional workhorses  a number of innovative browser plug-ins have appeared  particularly for the increasingly popular Firefox browser.  For example  there are plug-ins that enable the user to view and work with the HTML and other elements of the page being viewed.  Another popular area is plug-ins that make it easier to capture and organize material from Web pages  going well beyond the standard favorites or bookmark facility.
