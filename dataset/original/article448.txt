447 Dell Computer (NASDAQ: DELL) is one of the worldâ€™s leading manufacturers and sellers of desktop and laptop computers  .  By 2008 Dell had more than 88 000 employees worldwide. The company was founded by Michael Dell  a student at the University of Texas at Austin whose first company was PCâ€™s Limited  founded in 1984.  Even at this early stage Dell successfully employed several practices that would come to typify the Dell strategy: Sell directly to customers (not through stores)  build each machine to suit the customerâ€™s preferences  and be aggressive in competing on price. In 1988 the growing company changed its name to Dell Computer Corporation.  In the early 1990s Dell tried an alternative business model  selling through warehouse clubs and computer superstores.  When that met with little success  Dell returned to the original formula.  In 1999 Dell overtook Compaq to become the biggest computer retailer in America.
