31 Ontologies can be used to provide guidance to a variety oftypes of programs (for example  see expert system  natural language processing  and software agent).  Thusif an automatic news summarizer program encounters astory that includes references to opposing lawyers and legalissues  it could apply an ontology that defines the likelyrelationship of the participants in the case. Creating useful ontologies is quite labor intensive interms of the human thinking and coding involved.  However  there have been substantial efforts in recent years tocreate anthologies for many fields  particularly in biologyand genetics.  The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is apopular tool for creating ontologies that can be used tomake Web content more understandable to programs  . Meanwhile  an ambitious and long-running projectcalled Cyc (for Encyclopedia) under the direction of Douglas Lenat has been engaged in creating what amounts tovast ontologies for many of the domains included in everyday human life as well as specialized fields of knowledge.  Alarge portion of this work has been made available as opensource.
