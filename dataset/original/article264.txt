263 many  services  today  use  the  popular  BitTorrent  file-shar-ing protocol.  A BitTorrent client (either the program of that name  or  another  compatible  one)  can  transmit  or  receive any  type  of  data.   To  share  a  file   the  client  creates  a  â€œtor-rentâ€â€”a  small  file  that  contains  metadata  describing  the file and an assignment to a â€œtracker. â€ The tracker is another computer  (node)  that  coordinates  the  distribution  of  the file.  Although this sounds complicated and a request takes longer  to  set  up  than  an  ordinary  HTTP  connection   the advantage  is  that  once  set  up   downloading  is  efficiently managed  even  for  files  for  which  there  is  high  demand.  The  downloading  client  connects  to  multiple  clients  that provide  pieces  of  the  desired  file.   Because  of  its  efficiency  BitTorrent allows for distribution of substantial amounts of data  at  low  cost   particularly  since  the  system  â€œscales  upâ€ automatically  without  having  to  provide  extra  resources.  BitTorrent  is  currently  being  used  for  a  variety  of  legally distributed  material   including  video   sound   and  textual content
