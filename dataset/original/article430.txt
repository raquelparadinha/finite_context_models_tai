429 The data acquisition system begins with a transducer  which is a device that converts a physical phenomenon (such as heat) into a proportional electrical signal.  Transducers include devices such as thermistors  thermocouples  and pressure or strain gauges.  The output of the transducer is then fed into a signal conditioning circuit.  The purpose of signal conditioning is to make sure the signal fits into the range needed by the data processing device.  Thus the signal may be amplified or its voltage may be adjusted or scaled to the required level.  Another function of signal conditioning is to isolate the incoming signal from the computer to which the acquisition device is connected.  This is necessary both to protect the delicate computer circuits from possible â€œspikesâ€ in the incoming signal and to prevent â€œnoiseâ€ (extraneous electromagnetic signals created by the computer itself) from distorting the signal  and thus the ultimate measurements.  Various sorts of filters can be added for this purpose.
