54 There are many sources of podcasts.  News organizations can provide regular audio or video podcasts as a supplement to regular text material.  Podcasting also offers a way for a small news organization or independent journalist to build an audience using equipment as simple as a microphone and perhaps a video camera.  Podcasts also provide a way for political organizations to keep in touch with supporters (and perhaps supply them with talking points).  Any source of periodically distributed audio or video can be a candidate for podcasting.  These include class lectures  corporate communications  and even religious services
