195 An interpreter is a program that analyzes (parses) program-ming commands or statements in a high-level language     creates  equivalent  executable instructions in machine code   and executes them.  An interpreter differs from a compiler in that the lat-ter converts the entire program to an executable file rather than processing and executing it a statement at a time . many  earlier  versions  of  the  BASIC  programming  lan-guage  were  implemented  as  interpreters.   Since  an  inter-preter only has to hold one program statement at a time in memory  it could run on early microcomputers that had only a  few  tens  of  thousands  of  bytes  of  system  memory.   How-ever   interpreters  run  programs  considerably  more  slowly than a compiled program would run.  One reason is that an interpreter â€œthrows awayâ€ each source code statement after it  interprets  it.   This  means  that  if  a  statement  runs  repeat-edly    it must be re-interpreted each time it runs.  A  compiler   on  the  other  hand   would  create  only  one  set of  machine  code  instructions  for  the  loop  and  then  move on.   Also   because  a  compiler  keeps  the  entire  program  in memory   it  can  analyze  the  relationship  between  multiple statements  and  recognize  ways  to  rearrange  or  substitute them for greater efficiency.
