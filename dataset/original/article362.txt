361 Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is used to periodically verify the identity of the peer using a 3-way handshake.  This isdone upon initial link establishmentâ€š and MAY be repeated anytime after thelink has been established. After the Link Establishment phase is completeâ€š the authenticator sendsa â€œchallengeâ€ message to the peer which is a random byte-sequence as wellas the identifierâ€š a randomly generated number.  The peer responds with avalue calculated using a â€œone-way hashâ€ function.  The authenticator checksthe response against its own calculation of the expected hash value.  If thevalues matchâ€š the authentication is acknowledged; otherwise the connectionSHOULD be terminated. CHAP provides protection against playback attack through the use of anincrementally changing identifier and a variable challenge value.  The use ofrepeated challenges is intended to limit the time of exposure to any singleattack.  The authentication can occur between client and serverâ€š in largerinfrastructuresâ€š howeverâ€š the administration of keys or passwords can bequite a big effort. CHAP also supports the use of central server that acts as a central certification unit according to such asâ€š the Remote Access Dial-in User Serviceprinciple or is in control of the frequency and timing of the challenges.
