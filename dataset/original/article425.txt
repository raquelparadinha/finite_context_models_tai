424 An expert system has two main components  a knowledge baseand an inference engine.  The knowledge base consists of a set of assertions (facts) or of rules expressed as if .  .  .  then statements that specify conditions that  if true  allow a particular inference to be drawn  .  The inference engine accepts new assertions or queries and tests them against the stored rules.  Because satisfying one rule can create a condition that is to be tested by a subsequent rule  chains of reasoning can be built up.  If the reasoning is from initial facts to an ultimate conclusion  it is called forward chaining.  If a conclusion is given and the goal is to prove that conclusion  there can be backward chaining from the conclusion to the assertions
