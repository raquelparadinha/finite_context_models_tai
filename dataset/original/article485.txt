484 By itself  a Web page coded in HTML is simply a â€œstaticâ€ display that does not interact with the user (other than for the selection of links).  (See html  dhtml  and xhtm. ) Many Web services  including online databases and e-commerce transactions  require that the user be able to interact with the server.  For example  an online shopper may need to browse or search a catalog of CD titles  select one or more for purchase  and then complete the transaction by providing credit card and other information.  These functions are provided by â€œgateway programsâ€ on the server that can access databases or other facilities. One way to provide interaction with (and through) a Web page is to use the CGI (common gateway interface).  CGI is a facility that allows Web browsers and other client programs to link to and run programs stored on a Web site.  The stored programs  called scripts  can be written in various languages such as JavaScript or PHP   and placed in a cgi-bin folder on the Web server. The CGI script is referenced by an HTML hyperlink on the Web page  such as<A HREF=â€œhttp://www. MyServer. com/cgi-bin/MyScriptâ€>MyScript </A>
