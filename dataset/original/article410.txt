409 There are a variety of ways to electronically register  store  and process votes.  In recent years older manual systems (paper ballots or mechanical voting machines) have been replaced in many areas with systems ranging from purely digital (touch screens) to hybrid systems where marked paper ballots are scanned and tabulated by machine.  However  voting systems have been subject to considerable controversy  particularly following the Florida debacle in the 2000 U. S.  presidential election. The criteria by which voting systems are evaluated include:  how easy it is for the voter to understand and use the system  accessibility for disabled persons  whether the voterâ€™s intentions are accurately recorded   the ability to make a permanent record of the vote  prevention of tampering (physical or electronic)  provisions for independent auditing of the votes in case of disputeThe degree to which a given system meets these criteria can vary considerably because of both design and implementation issues.
