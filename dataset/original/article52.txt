51 By the mid-1990s  Intel was promoting a standard for the automated detection and configuration of devices.  Known as Plug and Play (PnP)  this standard was incorporated in versions of Microsoft Windows starting with Windows 95  .  The required hardware support soon appeared on PC motherboards and expansion cards. With Plug and Play the user simply connects a printer  scanner  or other device to the PC.  Windows detects that a device has been connected and queries it for its official name and other information.  If necessary  Windows can then prompt the user for a disk containing the appropriate driver or even search for a driver on a Web site. The concept of Plug and Play extends beyond the Windows world  however.  In recent years there has been interest in developing a Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol by which a variety of devices could automatically configure themselves with any of a variety of different networks.  This would be particularly helpful for home users who are increasingly setting up small networks so they can share broadband Internet connections  as well as the growing number of users who want their desktop PC to work with handheld (palm) computers and other devices.  Microsoft supports UPnP in versions of Windows starting with ME and XP.
