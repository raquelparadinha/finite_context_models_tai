453 Also called digital money or e-cash  digital cash represents the attempt to create a method of payment for online transactions that is as easy to use as the familiar bills and coins in daily commerce  .  At present  credit cards are the principal means of making online payments.  While using credit cards takes advantage of a well-established infrastructure  it has some disadvantages.  From a security standpoint  each payment potentially exposes the payer to the possibility that the credit card number and possibly other identifying information will be diverted and used for fraudulent transactions and identity theft.  While the use of secure (encrypted) online sites has reduced this risk  it cannot be eliminated entirely  .  Credit cards are also impracticable for very small payments from cents to a few dollars (such as for access to magazine articles) because the fees charged by the credit card companies would be too high in relation to the value of the transaction.
