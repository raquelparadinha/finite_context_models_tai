204 Internationalization  and  localization  are  ways  to  adapt computer  software  (often  created  in  the  United  States  or Europe) to other languages and cultures.  The abbreviations I18n and L10n are sometimes used for internationalization and  localization   respectively  (the  numbers  in  each  word refer  to  the  number  of  letters  in  the  alphabet  between  the letters).  The two processes are complementary.
