37 Once the document page has been scanned into an imageformat  there are various ways to identify the characters. One method is to use stored templates that indicate the pattern of pixels that should correspond to each character.  Generally  a threshold of similarity is defined so that an exactmatch is not necessary to classify a character: The templatemost similar to the character is chosen.  Some systems storea set of templates for each of the fonts most commonly foundin printed text.  (Recognizing cursive writing is a much morecomplex process: See handwriting recognition. )A more generalized method uses structural features(such as â€œall tâ€™s have a single vertical line and a shortercrossbar lineâ€) to classify characters.  To analyze a character the different types of individual features are identified andthen compared to a set of rules to determine the charactercorresponding to that particular combination of features. Sometimes thresholds or â€œfuzzy logicâ€ are used to decidethe probable identity of a character.
