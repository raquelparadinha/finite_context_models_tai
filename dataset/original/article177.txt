176 Since the late 1990s  Web users (particularly younger ones)have been adept at sharing media content online  .  In the 2000 decade  however the emphasis has shifted to users not merely sharing otherpeoplesâ€™ content  but creating their own  .  The first part of the recipe was the availability ofubiquitous digital cameras and camcorders; the second partwas easy-to-use video-editing software; and the third partwas a Web site that could host the results. Created in 2005 by three former PayPal employees  thevideo-sharing site YouTube has been the leading venue foramateur video.  Although available content includes clipsfrom movies and TV shows (some unauthorized)  much ofthe most interesting content is original videos created anduploaded by users.  Beyond just sharing or accessing con-tent  users are encouraged to rate and comment on the vid-eos they see  and users can also subscribe to â€œfeedsâ€ of newmaterial that is likely to be of interest to them. By 2008 more than 83 million videos were available onYouTubeâ€”and hundreds of thousands added each day.
