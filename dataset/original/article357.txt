356 Extranet helps the organization to link the outside world such as suppliersand customers with a private intranet.  While this is similar to the internetâ€šaccess is controlled and restricted to particular groupsâ€š similar to the Intranet. Accordinglyâ€š an Extranet web server can be accessed by all the participantsinvolved in a project (e. g. â€š various engineers and the firm developing a newproduct)â€š but not by anyone else.  In this exampleâ€š the Extranet providesproject management functions for the work in progress and the work teamsinvolved.  The security is increased; howeverâ€š breaches can still occur (e. g. â€šcyberpunk getting hold of a password or access to a server whoâ€š with apasswordâ€š is given access to the Extranet)
