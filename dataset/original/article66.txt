65 Passive RFID tags have no power supply; the power induced by the reading signal is used to transmit the response.  Because this power is very small  passive tags can only be read at distances from about 4 inches (10 cm) to a few yards (meters)  depending on the antenna size and type.  The main advantage of passive tags is that the lack of a battery makes them small  lightweight  and inexpensive  making them ideal for attaching to merchandise (they have also been embedded under the skin of pets and  in a few cases  even people).  Smart cards for use in transit systems and similar applications are also passive; the system is activated by â€œtaggingâ€ or bringing the card near the reader. Active RFID tags have their own battery.  Their advantage is that they are able to initiate communication with the reader  and the signal they send is much stronger  more reliable  and with greater range (up to about 1 500 feet [500 m]).  The stronger signal allows for communication in rougher environments (such as outdoors for tracking cattle or shipping containers).
