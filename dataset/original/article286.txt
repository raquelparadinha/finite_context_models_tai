285 Fortran  (FORmula  TRANslator)  was  the  first  widely used  high-level  programming  language.   It  was  developed by a project begun in 1954 by a team under the leadership of I  Bm researcher John Backus.  The goal of the project was to create a language that would allow mathematicians  sci-entists  and engineers to express calculations in something close  to  the  traditional  notation.   At  the  same  time   a  com-piler  would  have  to  be  carefully  designed  so  that  it  would produce  executable  machine  code  that  would  be  nearly  as efficient as the code that would have been created through the more tedious process of using assembly languages.  (See compileR and assembleR. )
