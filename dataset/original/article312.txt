311 Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) allows voice  video anddata to be transmitted over a single telephone line at up to 6. 144 megabitsper second (Mbps) in a single direction  with significantly slower speedsin the other direction.  Accordingly  it is very appropriate for downloading large amounts of data but for certain applications  such as videoconferencing  other technologies work better [see also Very-High-bit-rateDigital Subscriber Line (VDSL)  Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) modulation Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM-VDSL)].
