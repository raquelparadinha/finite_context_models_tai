254 A  fiber  optic  (or  optical  fiber)  cable  transmits  photons (light)  instead  of  electrons.   Depending  on  the  diameter  of the cable  the light is guided either by total internal reflec-tion  or  as  a  waveguide  (manipulating  refraction).   These principles were known as early as the mid-19th century and began to be used in the 20th century for such applications as  dental  and  medical  illumination  and  in  experiments  in transmitting images for television.
