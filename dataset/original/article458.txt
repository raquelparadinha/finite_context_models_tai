457 By default  once information is digitized it is simply a pattern of bits that can be easily copied within the same or a different medium  using a variety of software or the built-in facilities of the operating system.  Of course the development of tape-recording technology in the mid-20th century already made it possible to copy audio recordings  and the later development of videotape and the VCR did the same for video.  However  while analog copying techniques lose some accuracy (or fidelity) with each generation of copying  digital files can be copied exactly each time.  It is equally easy to e-mail  upload  or otherwise distribute audio or video files. Legally  the creator of an original work can assert copyrightâ€”literally  the â€œright to copyâ€ or to control when and how the work is distributed.  Digital rights management (DRM) refers to a variety of technologies that can be used to enforce this right by making it at least difficult for the purchaser of one copy of a work to copy and distribute it in turn.  (Similar technologies have also been used to prevent copying of software  which is  after all  just another pattern of bitsâ€”see copy protection and software piracy andcounterfeiting. )
