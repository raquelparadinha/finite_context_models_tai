205 By  the  mid-2000  decade   the  biggest  intellectual  property battles  were  not  about  esoteric  program  codes  but  rather revolved around how to satisfy the ordinary home consum-erâ€™s  appetite  for  music  and  video  while  preserving  produc-ersâ€™  revenues.   Increasingly   music  and  even  video  is  being downloaded rather than being bought in commercial pack-aging at the local store. In  the Sony  v.   Universal  case  (1984)  the  Supreme  Court ruled  that  manufacturers  of  devices  such  as  VCRs  were not  liable  for  their  misuse  if  there  were  â€œsubstantial  non-infringing usesâ€â€”such as someone making a copy of legally possessed  media  for  their  own  use.   However   in  2005  the Supreme  Court  ruled  that grokster   a  decentralized  file-sharing service  could be held liable for the distribution of illegally copied media if it â€œactively inducedâ€ such copying. By   2006   media   industry   lobbyists   (particularly   the Recording  Industry  Institute  of  America   or  RIAA)  were promoting  a  number  of  bills  in  Congress  that  would  fur-ther  restrict  consumersâ€™  rights  to  use  media.   Such  mea-sures might include requiring that devices be able to detect â€œflaggedâ€  media  and  refuse  to  copy  it      as  well  as  adding  stricter  provisions  to  the Digital millennium  Copyright  Act  (DmCA).   These  mea-sures  are  opposed  by  cyber-libertarian  groups  such  as  the Electronic Frontier Foundation and consumer groups such as the Home Recording Rights Coalition.
