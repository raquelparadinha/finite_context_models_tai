298 Timing attacks were publicized by Paul Kocher in 1996.  They attack the implementation of cryptosystems by measuring observable differences in the timing of the algorithm based on the particular value of the key.  They then use statistical methods to determine the bits of key by observing many operations using the same key.  Timing attacks typically require a significant number of chosen ciphertexts.  Related attacks can use any measure of differences in the performance of the encryption and decryption functions such as power consumption and heat dissipation.  Timing attacks and related attacks can be protected against to some degree by â€œblindingâ€ the devices performing encryption and decryption computations so that all computations have the same performance  regardless of the particular key and message being used.  However  this can have a substantial performance cost  as it requires all computations to have worst-case performance.  Such attacks can also be protected against by designing systems so that they will not act as an â€œoracleâ€ by decrypting and returning all and any messages that come their way  thereby preventing an attacker from obtaining the necessary data to carry out the attack.  However  this is not always possible without interfering with the purpose of the system.
