113 There are a number of ways that sound can be sampled  stored  or generated digitally  .  Here we will look at some of the most popular sound file formats. WAVThe WAV (wave) file format is specific to Microsoft Windows.  It essentially stores the raw sample data that represents the digitized audio content  including information about the sampling rate (which in turns affects the sound quality).  Since WAV files are not compressed  they can consume considerable disk space. AIFFAIFF stands for Audio Interchange File Format  and is specific to the Apple Macintosh and to Silicon Graphics (SGI) platforms.  Like WAV  it stores actual sound sample data.  A variant  AIFF-C  can store compressed sound. AUThe AU (audio) file format was developed by Sun Microsystems and is used mainly on UNIX systems  and also in Java programming. MIDIMIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface.  Unlike most other sound formats  MIDI files donâ€™t represent sampled sound data.  Rather  they represent virtual musical instruments that synthesize sound according to complex algorithms that attempt to mirror the acoustic characteristics of real pianos  guitars  or other instruments.  Since MIDI is like a â€œscoreâ€ for the virtual instruments rather than storing the sounds  it is much more compact than sampled sound formats.  MIDI is generally used for music composition rather than casual listening. MP3MP3 is actually a component of the MPEG (Moving Picture Expert Group) multimedia standard  and stands for MPEG1 Audio Layer 3.  It is now the most popular sound format  using compression to provide a balance of sound quality
