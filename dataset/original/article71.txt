70 Industrial robots work in an extremely restricted environment  so their world representation can be quite simple.  However  robots that can move about in the environment have also been developed.  Military programs have developed automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) with wheels or tracks  capable of navigating a battlefield and scouting or attacking the enemy  .  Space-going robots including the Sojourner Mars rover also have considerable onboard â€œintelligence â€ although their overall tasks are programmed by remote commands. Indeed  the extent to which mobile robots are truly autonomous varies considerably.  At one end is the â€œrobotâ€ that is steered and otherwise controlled by its human operator  such as law enforcement robots that can be sent into dangerous hostage situations.  (Another example is the robots that fight in arena combat in the popular Robot Warsshows. )
