491 The earliest computer chess theorists such as Claude Shannon and Alan Turing saw the game as one potential way to demonstrate true machine intelligence.  Ironically  by the time computers had truly mastered chess  the artificial intelligence (AI) community had concluded that mastering the game was largely irrelevant to their goals.  AI pioneers Herbert Simon and John McCarthy have referred to chess as â€œthe Drosophila of AI. â€ By this they mean that  like the ubiquitous fruit flies in genetics research  chess became an easy way to measure computer prowess.  But what was it measuring? The dominant brute-force approach was more a measure of computing power than the application of such AI techniques as pattern recognition.  (There is  however  still some interest in writing chess programs that â€œthinkâ€ more like a human player. ) In recent years there has been some interest in programming computers to play the Asian board game Go  where positional and structural elements play a greater role than in chess.  However  even the latest generation of Go programs seem to be relying more on a statistical approach than a deep conceptual analysis.
