94 In 1982  Andrew Fuegelman created a program called PC-Talk.  This program provided a better way for users with modems to connect to the many bulletin board systems that were starting to spring up.  Fluegelman was familiar with the common practice of public radio and TV broadcasters of soliciting pledge payments to help support their â€œfreeâ€ service.  He decided to do something similar with his program.  He distributed it to many bulletin boards  where users could download it for free.  However  he asked users who liked the program and wanted to continue to use it to pay him $25. Fluegelman dubbed his method of software distribution â€œfreewareâ€ (because it cost nothing to try out the program).  Other programmers began to use the same method with their own software.  This included Jim Knopf  author of the PC-File database program  and Bob Wallace  who offered PC-Write as a full-featured alternative to expensive commercial word processing program.  Because Fluegelman had trademarked the term freeware  these other authors began to call their offerings shareware. Today freeware means software that can be downloaded at no cost and for which there is no charge for continued use.  The program may be redistributed by users as long as they donâ€™t charge for it
