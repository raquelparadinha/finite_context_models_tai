224 Variations of genetic algorithms or â€œevolutionary program-mingâ€ have been used for many applications.  In engineering development  a virtual environment can be set up in which a  simulated  device  such  as  a  robot  arm  can  be  allowed  to evolve  until  it  is  able  to  perform  to  acceptable  specifica-tions.  (NASA has also used genetic programs competing on 80 computers to design a space antenna. ) Different versions of an expert system program can be allowed to compete at performing  tasks  such  as  predicting  the  behavior  of  finan-cial markets.  Finally  a genetic program is a natural way to simulate  actual  biological  evolution  and  behavior  in  fields such as epidemiology
