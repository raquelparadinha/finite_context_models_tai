454 The concept of digital convergence is an attempt to explore the implications of so many formerly disparate analog media now being available in digital form.  All forms of digital media have key features in common.  First  they are essentially pure information (computer data).  This means that regardless of whether the data originally represented still images from a camera  video  or film  the sound of a human voice  music  or some other form of expression  that data can be stored  manipulated  and retrieved under the control of computer algorithms.  This makes it easier to create seamless multimedia presentations  .  Services or products previously considered to be separate can be combined in new ways.
