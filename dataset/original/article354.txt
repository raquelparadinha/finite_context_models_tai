353 Encryption is the process of conversion of an easily understood format (text)into another format apparently lacking sense because it is encoded.  Theencrypted text is called ciphertext  . In the Encryption context  Algorithms use a key to control encryption anddecryption (See Algorithm)  two categories are used:Symmetric (or Secret-key): Uses the same key for encryption & decryption  orthe latter key is easily derived from the encryption key  . Asymmetric (or Public key): A different key is used for encrypting and decrypting a message; accordingly  the decrypting key cannot be derived from theencrypting key.  (See also Algorithms  Tables 11A and 11B). A majority of cryptographic products are software rather than hardwarebased.  Moreover  many are communications-oriented rather than data storageoriented; they heavily tend towards secure electronic mail  IP security (IPsec) and Virtual Private Network applications. In 1999 a report identified 805 hardware and / or software products incorporating cryptography manufactured in 35 countries outside the UnitedStates.  Most were manufactured in these countries in that order:United Kingdom  followed by Germany  Canada  Australia  Switzerland Sweden  the Netherlands  and Israel. Other countries accounted for slightly more than a quarter of the worldâ€™stotal of encryption products.  Table 11A outlines some of the algorithms thathave been used based on the DES standard. Table 11B outlines the various standards that were submitted for testingand examination.  These finalists were part of the tests being undertaken toselect the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Rijndael
