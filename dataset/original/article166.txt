165 Thousands of real-time views of the world are available on the Web.  These include everything from the prosaic (a coffee machine at MIT) to the international (a view of downtown Paris or Tokyo) to the sublime (a Rocky Mountain sunset).  All of these views are made possible thanks to the availability of inexpensive digital cameras  . To create a basic webcam  the user connects a digital camera to a PC  usually via a USB cable.  A program controls the camera  taking a picture at frequent intervals (perhaps every 30 seconds or minute).  The picture is received from the camera as a JPG (JPEG) file.  The program then uploads the picture to the userâ€™s Web page (usually using file transfer protocol  or ftp)  replacing the previous picture.  Users connected to the Web site can click to see the latest picture.  Alternatively  a script running on the server can update the picture automatically.
