227 geographic  data  can  be  stored  as  either  a  raster  or  a vector representation.  A raster system divides the area into a grid and assigns values to each cell in the grid.  For exam-ple  each cell might be coded according to its highest point of elevation  the amount of vegetation (ground cover) it has  its  population  density   or  any  other  factor  of  interest.   The simple  grid  system  makes  raster  data  easy  to  manipulate  but the data tends to be â€œcoarseâ€ since there is no informa-tion about variations within a cell.
