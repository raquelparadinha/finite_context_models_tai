253 The  amount  of  fault  tolerance  to  be  provided  for  a  sys-tem depends on a number of factors:     How important is it that the system not fail?       How critical is a given component to the operation of the system?       How  likely  is  it  that  a  given  component  will  fail? (mean time between failures  or mBTF)       How expensive is it to make the component or system fault tolerant?
