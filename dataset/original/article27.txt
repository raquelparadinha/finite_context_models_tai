26 Online games today range from elaborate war games toopen-ended fantasy worlds to virtual universes that mirrorâ€œreal-worldâ€ activities  including economics  politics  andeven education. The first online games appeared in the late 1970s onPLATO  an educational network  as well as on the earlyInternet of the 1980s.  These MUDs (multiuser dungeons)were generally based on pen-and-paper role-playing gamesof the time  notably Dungeons & Dragons.  These games were text based  with players typing their charactersâ€™ actionsand dialog while the changing world as seen by the players was similarly described.  By the early 1990s  however MUDs had spun off many variants.  Many were still â€œhacknâ€™ slashâ€ dungeon games (which were also offered on America Online and other commercial services).  Many of theseMUD-like games such as AOLâ€™s Neverwinter Nights offeredsimple graphics.  Meanwhile other games began to offermore sophisticated social interactions as well as the abilityof players to make their own additions to the game world including buildings.
