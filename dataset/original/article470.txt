469 The use of a processor cache is advantageous because instructions and data can be fetched more quickly from the cache (static memory chips next to or within the CPU) than they can be retrieved from the main memory (usually dynamic RAM).  An algorithm analyzes the instructions currently being executed by the processor and tries to anticipate what instructions and data are likely to be needed in the near future.  (For example  if the instructions call for a possible branch to one of two sets of instructions  the cache will load the set that has been used most often or most recently.  Since many programs loop over and over again through the same instructions until some condition is met  the cacheâ€™s prediction will be right most of the time. )
