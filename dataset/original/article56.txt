55 Early computer printers were limited to one or a few built-in fonts  either stamped on typewriter style keys on daisy wheels  or stored as patterns in the printerâ€™s software (with dot matrix printers).  In the mid-1970s  when Xerox researchers were developing the laser printer  they realized they needed an actual programming language that could describe fonts  graphics  and other elements that could be printed on the more versatile new printers.  PARC researchers developed InterPress; meanwhile two of them  John Warnock and Chuck Geschke  founded their own company in 1982  .  They then created a more streamlined version of InterPress that they called PostScript.  The first printer to include built-in PostScript capability was Appleâ€™s LaserWriter  in 1985.  PostScript soon became the standard for a burgeoning industry  . Because PostScript is an actual programming language (for a somewhat similar language  see Forth)  software such as word processors can include functions that turn a text document into a PostScript document  ready for printing.  A PostScript interpreter in the printer (or even in another application) interprets the PostScript commands to re-create the document.  The commands specify rasters (combinations of straight lines and curves)  which can be scaled and transformed to provide the specified output  including fonts  which can be enhanced by including â€œhintsâ€ to help the system identify key features.  This processor is thus sometimes called a Raster Image Processor (RIP)
