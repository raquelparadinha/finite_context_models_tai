402 Social Engineering is a technique where persuasion and/or deception are usedto gain access to the systems.  This is typically implemented through humanconversation or other interaction.  Typical example of this is an attack wherea hacker pretends to be a high positioned IT executive traveling on companybusiness and having problems to connect to the organizationâ€™s informationsystem through its remote access point. The person may gradually succeed in persuading the Help Desk operatorto tell him or her all the necessary details for the connection set-up.  Later onattacker calls again  complaining that his password for some reason does notwork and persuades the Help Desk to change it to a password of her or hisliking.  Hence  the person may gain unauthorized access  . The term can also be applied to exploiting the victimâ€™s good intentions andlack of in-depth technical knowledge in order to inspire fear and confusion. This process is often considered in the context of â€˜memeticsâ€™  which dealswith the transfer of memes (the â€˜unit of cultural inheritanceâ€™) from brain tobrain. Where social engineering is linked to an IT security issue or hoax  it nearlyalways trades on technophobia
