421 Transmitting data involves the sending of bits (ones and zeros) as signaled by some alternation in physical characteristics (such as voltage or frequency).  There are a number of ways in which errors can be introduced into the data stream.  For example  electrical â€œnoiseâ€ in the line might be interpreted as spurious bits  or a bit might be â€œflippedâ€ from one to zero or vice versa.  Generally speaking  the faster the rates at which bits are being sent  the more sensitive the transmission is to effects that can cause errors. While a few wrong characters might be tolerated in some text messages or graphics files  binary files representing executable programs must generally be received perfectly  since random changes can make programs fail or produce incorrect results.  Data communications engineers have devised a number of methods for checking the accuracy of data transmissions
