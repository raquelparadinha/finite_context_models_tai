6 Netnews postings are simply text files that begin with a set of standard headers  similar to those used in e-mail.  (Like e-mail  news postings can have binary graphics or program files attached  using a standard called MIME  for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. )The files are stored on news serversâ€”machines that have the spare capacity to handle the hundreds of gigabytes of messages now posted each week.  The files are stored in a typical hierarchical UNIX fashion  grouped into approximately 75 000 different newsgroups. As shown in the following table  the newsgroups are broken down into 10 major categories.  The names of individual groups begin with the major category and then specify subdivisions.  For example  the newsgroup comp. sys. ibm. pc deals with IBM PC-compatible personal computers  while comp. os. linux deals with the Linux operating system.
