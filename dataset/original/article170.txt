169 When a user types in (or clicks on) a link in the browser window  the browser sends a HTTP request  .  To construct the request  the browser first looks at the address (URL) in the user request.  An address such as http://www. well. com/conferencing. html consists of three parts In order to direct the browserâ€™s request to the appropriate host and server  the browser sends the URL to a name server  .  The name server provides the appropriate numeric IP address  .  The browser then sends an HTTP â€œgetâ€ request to the serverâ€™s IP address. Assuming the page requested is valid  the server sends the HTML file to the browser.  The browser in turn interprets the formatting and display instructions in the HTML file and â€œrendersâ€ the text and graphics appropriately.  It is remarkable that this whole process from user click to displayed page usually takes only a few seconds  even if the Web site is thousands of miles away and requests must be relayed through many intervening computers
