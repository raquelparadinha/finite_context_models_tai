192 JavaScript  is  one  of  several  popular  languages  that  can enable  Web  pages  to  interact  with  users  more  quickly  and efficiently  .  The  language  first  appeared  in  the  mid-1990sâ€™  Netscape  2 browser under the name LiveScript.  Technically  JavaScript is  the  Sun microsystems  trademark  for  its  implementation of  a  standard  called  ECmAScript.   Despite  the  name   Java-Script  is  not  directly  related  to  the  Java  programming  lan-guage. In  its  early  years  JavaScript  was  perhaps  a  victim  of  its own  success.   Having  a  relatively  easy-to-use  scripting  lan-guage  provided  an  easier  way  to  add  features  such  as  3D buttons  and  pop-up  windows  to  formerly  humdrum  Web forms.   However   as  with  an  earlier  generationâ€™s  fondness for multiple fonts  early JavaScript programmers were often prone  to  add  unnecessary  and  confusing  clutter  to  Web pages.   Besides  sometimes  annoying  users   early  JavaScript also  suffered  from  significant  differences  in  how  it  was implemented  by  the  major  browsers.   As  a  result   Netscape users  were  sometimes  stymied  by  JavaScript  written  for micr  osoft Internet Explorer  and vice versa.  Finally  browser flaws have sometimes allowed JavaScript to be used to com-promise  security  such  as  by  installing  malware-infested â€œbrowser helpers. â€ As a result  many security experts began to  recommend  that  users  disable  JavaScript  execution  in their browsers.
