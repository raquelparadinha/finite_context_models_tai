92 There are basically two ways to move data from a computer to or from a peripheral device such as a printer or modem.  A byte (8 bits) of data can be moved all at once  with each bit traveling along its own wire  .  Alternatively  a single wire can be used to carry the data one bit at a time.  Such a connection is called a serial port. The serial port receives data a full byte at a time from the computer bus and uses a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) to extract the bits one at a time and send them through the port.  A corresponding circuit at the other end accumulates the incoming bits and reassembles them into data bytes. The data bits for each byte are preceded by a start-bit to signal the beginning of the data and terminated by an stopbit.  Depending on the application  an additional bit may be used for parity  .  Devices connected by a serial port must â€œnegotiateâ€ by requesting a particular connection speed and parity setting.  Failure to agree results in gibberish being received.
