86 From microbiology to plasma physics  modern science would be impossible without the computer.  This is not because the computer has replaced the scientific method of observation  hypothesis  and experiment.  Modern scientists essentially follow the same intellectual procedures at did Galileo  Newton  Darwin  and Einstein.  Rather  understanding of the layered systems that make up the universe has now reached so complex and detailed a level that there is too much data for an individual human mind to grasp.  Further  the calculations necessary to process the data usually canâ€™t be performed by unaided humans in any reasonable length of time.  This can be caused either by the inherent complexity of the calculation   or the sheer amount of data (as in DNA sequencing; see bioinformatics and data mining)
