280 A flowchart is a diagram showing the â€œflowâ€ or progress of operations  in  a  computer  program.   Flowcharting  was  one of  the  earliest  aids  to  program  design  and  documentation  and a plastic template with standard flowcharting symbols was a common programming accessory.  Today CASE (com-puter-aided  software  engineering)  systems  often  include utilities  that  can  automatically  generate  flowcharts  based on  the  control  structures  and  procedure  calls  found  in  the program code. The standard flowchart symbols include blocks of vari-ous  shapes  that  represent  input/output   data  processing  sorting and collating  and so on.  Lines with arrows indicate the  flow  of  data  from  one  stage  or  process  to  the  next.   A diamond-shaped  symbol  indicates  a  decision  to  be  made by  the  program.   If  the  decision  is  an  â€œifâ€     separate  lines  branch  off  to  the  alternatives.  If the decision involves repeated testing    the line returns  back  to  the  decision  point  while  another  line  indi-cates  the  continuation  of  processing  after  the  loop  exits.  Devices  such  as  printers  and  disk  drives  have  their  own symbols  with  lines  indicating  the  flow  of  data  to  or  from the device
