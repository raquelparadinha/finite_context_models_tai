13 Neuroprosthetics is the creation of artificial limbs or sensoryorgans that are directly connected to the nervous system. The first (and most widely used) example is the cochlearimplant  which can restore hearing by taking sound signals from a microphone and converting them to electricalimpulses that directly stimulate auditory nerves within thecochlea  a part of the inner ear.  Similarly  experimental retinal implants that stimulate optic nerves are beginning tooffer crude but useful vision to certain blind patients. Research in connecting the brain to artificial arms orlegs is still in its early stages  but scientists using microelectrode arrays have been able to record signals from thebrainâ€™s neurons and correlate them to different types ofmotor movements.  In a series of experiments at Duke University  researchers first trained a monkey to operate a joystick to move a shape in a video game.  They then recordedand analyzed the signals produced by the monkeyâ€™s brainwhile playing the game  and correlated them with themotor movements in the joystick.  Next  they replicatedthese movements with a robotic arm as the monkey movedthe joystick.  Finally  they were able to train the monkey tomove the robotic arm without using the joystick at all  simply by â€œthinkingâ€ about the movements.
