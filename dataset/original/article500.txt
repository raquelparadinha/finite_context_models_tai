499 Short for â€œcoder/decoder â€ a codec is essentially an algorithm for encoding (and compressing) a stream of data for transmission  and then decoding and decompressing it at the receiving end.  Usually the data involved represents audio or video content  .  Typically the data is being downloaded from a Web site to be played on a personal computer or portable player  . A codec is described as â€œlossyâ€ if some of the original information is lost in the compression process.  It then becomes a question of whether the loss in quality is perceived by the user as significant.  A codec that preserves all the information needed to re-create the original file is â€œlossless. â€ For most purposes  the much greater size of the lossless version of a file is not worth the (often imperceptible) increase in quality or fidelity. A codec is usually used in connection with a â€œcontainer formatâ€ that specifies how the encoded data is to be stored in a file.  Often a container can hold more than one data stream and even more than one kind of media (such as video and audio).  When one refers to a Windows WAV file  for example  one is actually referring to a container.
