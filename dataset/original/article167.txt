166 The Web filter examines requests made by a Web user   and blocks those associated with sites deemed by the filter user to be objectionable.  There are two basic mechanisms for determining whether a site is unsuitable.  The first is to check the siteâ€™s address (URL) against a list and reject a request for any site on the list.  (Most filter programs come with default lists; the filter user can add other sites as desired.  Generally  the filter is installed with a password so only the authorized user [such as a parent] can change the filterâ€™s behavior. )The other filtering method relies on a list of keywords associated with objectionable activities (such as pornography).  When the user requests a site  the filter checks the page for words on the keyword list.  If a matching word or phrase is found  the site is blocked and not shown to the user.
