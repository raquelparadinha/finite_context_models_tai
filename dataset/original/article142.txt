141 The primary use of text editors today is to create programs and scripts.  These must generally be created using only standard ASCII characters    without all the embedded formatting commands and graphics found in word processing documents.  Programmerâ€™s text editors can be very sophisticated in their own right  providing features such as built in syntax checking and formatting or (as with the Emacs editor) the ability to program the editor itself.  Ultimately  however  program editors must create a source code file that can be processed by the compiler. Text editors are also useful for writing quick  short scripts   and can be handy for writing HTML code for the Web.  However  many Web pages are now designed using word processorâ€“like programs that convert the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) formatting into appropriate HTML codes automatically
