270 The  vulnerability  of  computer  systems  to  malicious  or criminal  attack  has  been  greatly  increased  by  the  growing number  of  connections  between  computers  (and  local  net-works)  and  the  worldwide  Internet   .   The  widespread  use of  permanent  broadband  connections  by  consumers  (such as  DSL  and  cable  modem  links)  has  increased  the  risk  to home  users.   Intruders  can  use  â€œport  scanningâ€  programs to  determine  what  connections  a  given  system  or  network has open  and can use other programs to snoop and steal or destroy sensitive data.
