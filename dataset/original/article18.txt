17 Many objects are more elaborate or specialized variations ofmore basic objects.  For example  in Microsoft Windows thevarious kinds of dialog boxes are specialized versions of thegeneral Window class.  Therefore  the specialized versionis created by declaring it to be derived from a â€œbase class. â€Put another way  the specialized class inherits the basicdata and functions available in the base (parent) class.  Theprogrammer can then add new data or functions or modifythe inherited ones to create the necessary behavior for thespecialized class. Languages such as C++ allow for a class to be derivedfrom more than one base class.  This is called multipleinheritance.  For example  a Message Window class mightinherit its overall structure from the Window class andits text-display capabilities from the Message class.  However  it can sometimes be difficult to keep the relationshipsbetween multiple classes clear.  The Java language takes thealternative approach of being limited to only single inheritance of classes  but allowing interfaces (specifications ofhow a class interacts with the program) to be multiplyinherited.
