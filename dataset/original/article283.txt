282 There  are  two  basic  ways  to  store  font  data  in  the computer  system.   Bitmapped  fonts  store  the  actual  pat-tern of tiny dots that make up the letters in the font.  This has  the  advantage  of  allowing  each  letter  in  each  point size  to  be  precisely  designed.   The  primary  disadvantage is  the  amount  of  memory  and  system  resources  required to  store  a  font  in  many  point  sizes.   In  practice   this  con-sideration  results  in  only  a  relatively  few  fonts  and  sizes being available.
