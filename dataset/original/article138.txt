137 Telecommuting (also called telework) is the ability to work from home or from some location other than the main office.  According to a report by the nonprofit organization WorldatWork  28. 7 million people worked from home at least one day a month in 2006.  (Self-employed persons  of course  have a much higher rate of working from home. )Telecommuting was made possible by the growing capabilities of home computers and the availability of network connections that allow the worker at home to have access to most of the people and facilities that would be available if the worker were on site.  Workers and companies that promote telecommuting often cite the following advantages:  elimination of stressful  time-wasting commutes  workers may be more productive because they have fewer office distractions  unnecessary meetings  etc.   reduction of traffic  air pollution  and fuel costs  greater flexibility in working hours  the ability of working parents with small children to combine child care and work to some extent  reduction of costs associated with office facilities
