2 As each new means of communication and social interaction is introduced  social customs and etiquette evolve in response.  For example  it took time before the practice of saying â€œhelloâ€ and identifying oneself became the universal way to initiate a phone conversation. By the 1980s  a system of topical news postings   carried on the Internet was becoming widely used in universities  the computer industry  and scientific institutions.  Many new users did not understand the system  and posted messages that were off topic.  Others used their postings as to insult or attack (â€œflameâ€) other users  particularly in newsgroups discussing perennially controversial topics such as abortion.  When a significant number of postings in a newsgroup are devoted to flaming and counter-flaming  many users who had sought civilized  intelligent discussion leave in protest. In 1984  Chuq von Rospach wrote a document entitled â€œA Primer on How to Work with the Usenet Community. â€ It and later guides to net etiquette or â€œnetiquetteâ€ offered useful guidelines to new users and to more experienced users who wanted to facilitate civil discourse.
