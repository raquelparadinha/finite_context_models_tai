75 Rich Text Format was developed in the later 1980s by programmers at Microsoft.  Its purpose is to allow for interchange of documents between Microsoft Word and other software  while preserving the original formatting. An RTF file is itself a plain text file containing the document text enclosed in control codes that determine the formatting. Although RTF is an 8-bit format  special escape sequences can be used to specify 16-bit Unicode characters  such as for non-Roman alphabets. Libraries and utilities are available for reading and writing RTF from most popular programming languages  including Perl  PHP  and Ruby. In practice  RTF created by word processors tends to contain many control codes needed to ensure compatibility with older programs  making the files bulky and not practicable to edit directly.  However  saving a file in RTF is a good way to ensure that a document can be used by recipients who may have  for example  older versions of Word.
