281 In computing  a font refers to a typeface that has a distinc-tive  appearance  and  style.   In  most  word  processing   desk-top publishing  and other programs the user can select the point  size  at  which  the  font  is  to  be  displayed  and  printed (in traditional typography each point size would be consid-ered to be a separate font).  Operating systems such as Win-A flowchart uses a set of simple symbols to describe the steps involved in a data processing operation.  The parallelograms indi-cate an input/output operation (such as reading or writing a file).  The â€œdecision diamondsâ€ have yes and no branches depending on the result of a test or comparison. 00        flowchartdows  and macintosh  usually  come  with  an  assortment  of fonts  and applications can register additional fonts to make them available to the system.
