303 access Control Matrix means preparing a system permitting to bring together user and the systemâ€™s available resources.  Preparing a matrix requires the following steps: A broad level of groups of resources that share the same or similar security objectives is established based on requirements for Confidentiality  Integrity  Availability  User Accountability  Authentication and Audit (Compliance) (CIA UAA).  The resources include files  directories  applications  databases  hosts services  processes and others including those protected by the operating system or by other mechanisms.  Users are grouped according to common security needs into functional teams and a group owner is identified who is responsible for group management If necessary  naming standards for resources can be defined based on the findings under 1 & 2 above  thereby further facilitating resource groupings.  Now a decision can be made on the degree of access such as read  write  execute  take ownership  access control  delete  purge  modify  file scan  .  Balancing central security control and group administration decides about the involvement of security administration.  A corporationâ€™s access control matrix should not become a static document but  instead  regular review and improvement is a must.  This matrix is closely linked to a Role-Based Access management system  whereby user roles (e. g.   nurse versus private or general physician) have roles to perform requiring access and modification of data or addition of new information regarding an electronic patient file.
