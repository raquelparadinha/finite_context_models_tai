265 With  todayâ€™s  networked  PCs  and  the  use  of  e-mail  attach-ments  it  is  easy  to  send  a  copy  of  a  file  or  files  from  one computer  to  another   because  networks  already  include  all the  facilities  for  doing  so.   Earlier   many  PCs  were  not  net-worked  but  could  be  connected  via  a  dial-up  modem.   To established the connection  a terminal program running on one  PC  had  to  negotiate  with  its  counterpart  on  the  other machine   agreeing  on  whether  data  would  be  sent  in  7-  or 8-bit  chunks   and  the  number  of  parity  bits  that  would  be included  for  error-checking   .   The sending  program  would  inform  the  receiving  program  as to  the  name  and  basic  type  of  the  file.   For  binary  files (files  intended  to  be  interpreted  as  literal  binary  codes   as with executable programs  images  and so on) the contents would be sent unchanged.  For text files  there might be the issue of which character set (7- bit or 8-bit ASCII) was being used  and whether the ends of lines were to be marked with a  CR  (carriage  return)  character   an  LF  (linefeed)   or  bot
