212 In  operating  systems  and  certain  programming  languages (such as LISP)  a heap is a pool of memory resources avail-able  for  allocation  by  programs.   The  memory  segments (sometimes called cells) can be the same size or of variable size.   If  the  same  size   they  are  linked  together  by  pointers  .    memory is then allocated for a vari-able by traversing the list and setting the required number of  cells  to  be  â€œownedâ€  by  that  variable.   (While  some  lan-guages such as Pascal and C use explicit memory allocation or deallocation functions  other languages such as LISP use a separate runtime module that is not the responsibility of the programmer. )
