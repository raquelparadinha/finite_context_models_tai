194 Java  is  a  computer  language  similar  in  structure  to  C++.  Although Java is a general-purpose programming language  it is most often used for creating applications to run on the Internet   such  as  Web  servers.   A  special  type  of  Java  pro-gram called an applet can be linked into Web pages and run on the userâ€™s Web browser  . As  an  object-oriented  language   Java  uses  classes  that provide commonly needed functions including the creation of user interface objects such as windows and buttons  .   A  variety  of sets  of  classes  (â€œclass  frameworksâ€)  are  available   such  as the AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit).
