131 The header information also includes:  The total length of the packet.  In theory packets can be as large as 65 kbytes; in practice they are limited to a smaller maximum.   An identification number that can be used if a packet is broken into smaller pieces for efficiency in transmission.  This allows the packet to be reassembled at the destination.   A â€œtime to liveâ€ value that specifies how many hops (movements from one intermediate host to another) the packet will be allowed to take.  This is reduced by 1 for each hop.  If it reaches 0  the packet is assumed to have gotten â€œlostâ€ or stale  and is discarded.   A protocol number (the protocol is usually TCP  see below).   A checksum for checking the integrity of the header itself (not the data in the packet).   The source and destination addresses. The source and destination are given as IP addresses  which are 32 bits long and typically written as four sets of up to three numbers eachâ€”for example  208. 162. 106. 17
