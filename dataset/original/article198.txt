197 Internet  radio  is  the  provision  of  radio  broadcast  content over  the  Internet   .   Basically   the  digitized sound  files  of  the  broadcasts  can  be  accessed  and  played using  widely  available  software  such  as  Windows media Player or RealPlayer.  Internet radio began in the mid-1990s  and  today  an  increasing  number  of  broadcast  stations  are offering their programming in this form  allowing them to reach  audiences  far  beyond  the  reach  of  their  signal.   Some stations  stream  live  (during  the  actual  broadcast)   while others  make  programs  available  for  download.   (For  auto-matic  downloading  of  broadcasts   see podcasting).   There are also â€œradio stationsâ€ that provide their content only via the  Internet.   Internet  radio  should  not  be  confused  with satellite or cable radio  which carry conventional radio sig-nals in real time.
