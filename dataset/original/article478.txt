477 The earliest design tool was the flowchart  often drawn with the aid of a template that could be used to trace the symbols on paper  .  With its symbols for the flow of execution through branching and looping  the flowchart provides a good tool for visualizing how a program is intended to work.  However large and complex programs often result in a sea of flowcharts that are hard to relate to one another and to the program as a whole.  Starting in the 1960s  the creation of programs for manipulating flow symbols made it easier both to design flowcharts and to visualize them in varying levels of detail.
