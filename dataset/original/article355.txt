354 nd User License Agreement (EULA) is a legally binding contract betweenthe developer or publisher of a software program (or application) and thepurchaser of that software.  The purchaser does not own the software but has merely a right to use it in accordance with the license agreement. During software installation  the EULA is usually shown and one is required to Accept or Refuse the terms  . In some cases  the EULA is written on the outside of the packaging withthe breaking of the seal to the CD  indicating acceptance of the EULA. In all cases  the EULA is the contract which users ignore at their peril;and whilst most EULAs contain broadly similar clauses and restrictions  itis important to confirm these before committing your organization.
