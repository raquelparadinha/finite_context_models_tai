221 A  number  of  handheld  computers  beginning  with  Appleâ€™s Newton in the mid-1990s and the now popular Palm devices and  BlackBerry  have  some  ability  to  recognize  handwrit-ing.   However   current  systems  can  be  frustrating  to  use 0        handwriting recognitionbecause accuracy often requires that users write very care-fully  and  consistently  or  (as  in  the  case  of  the  Palm)  even replace their usual letter strokes with simplified alternatives that the computer can more easily recognize.  If the user is allowed  to  use  normal  strokes   the  system  must  be  gradu-ally  â€œtrainedâ€  by  the  user  giving  writing  samples  and  con-firming the systemâ€™s guess about the letters.  As the software becomes  more  adaptable  and  processing  power  increases (allowing  more  sophisticated  algorithms  or  larger  neural networks  to  be  practical)  users  will  be  able  to  write  more naturally and systems will gain more consumer acceptance.  (One step in this direction is the Tablet PC  a notepad-sized computer with a digitizer tablet and a stylus and handwrit-ing recognitions  software   included  in  Windows xP  and expanded  in  Windows  Vista.   Programs  such  as microsoft OneNote  use  handwriting  recognition  to  allow  users  to incorporate  handwritten  text  into  notes  that  can  be  orga-nized and quickly retrieved. )Currently   handwriting  recognition  is  used  mainly  in niche  applications   such  as  collecting  signatures  for  deliv-ery services or filling out â€œelectronic formsâ€ in applications where  the  user  must  be  mobile  and  relatively  hands-free
