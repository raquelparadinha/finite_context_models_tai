442 A data structure is a way of organizing data for use in a computer program.  There are three basic components to a data structure: a set of suitable basic data types  a way to organize or relate these data items to one another  and a set of operations  or ways to manipulate the data. For example  the array is a data structure that can consist of just about any of the basic data types  although all data must be of the same type.  The way the data is organized is by storing it in sequentially addressable locations.  The operations include storing a data item (element) in the array and retrieving a data item from the array.
