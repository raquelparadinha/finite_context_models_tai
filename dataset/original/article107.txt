106 Sony Corporation (NYSE symbol: SNE) is the electronics business unit of Sony Group  a large Japanese multinational company that plays a leading role in worldwide electronics  games  and entertainment media (movies and music)  introducing and shaping many now-familiar standards. The company traces its origin to a radio repair shop started by Masaru Ibuka in a bombed-out building in Tokyo in 1945.  He was soon joined by Akio Morita  and the men started an electronics company whose name translates in English to Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation.  They started by building tape recorders  but in the early 1950s the two entrepreneurs were among the earliest to realize the potential of the transistor  marketing transistor radios starting in 1956.  The devices essentially established the modern consumer electronics field  perfectly fitting with a new music fad among American teenagersâ€”rock and roll. With their marketing success  Ibuka and Morita realized that they needed a simple  catchy name that would appeal to Americans and other non-Japanese customers.  In 1958 they came up with Sony.  Although the name did not exist in any language (and thus could be made proprietary)  â€œSonyâ€ evokes English words such as â€œsoundâ€ and â€œsonic. â€ (It also resembled a Japanese slang phrase â€œsony-sony â€ for something like what we would call â€œgeeksâ€ or â€œnerdsâ€ today. )
