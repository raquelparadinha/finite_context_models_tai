412 Concern about potential tampering with computers has led many jurisdictions to begin to replace touchscreen systems with optical-scan systems  where the voter marks a sturdy paper ballot.  (About half of U. S.  counties now use optical-scan systems. ) The advantage of optical systems is that the voter physically marks the ballot and can see how he or she has voted  and after tabulation the physical ballots are available for review in case of problems.  However  optical-scan ballots must be properly marked using the correct type of pencil  or they may not be read correctly.  Unlike the touchscreen  it is not possible to give the voter immediate feedback so that any errors can be corrected.  Optical-ballot systems may cost more because of paper and printing costs for the ballots  which may have to be prepared in several languages.  However this cost may be offset by not having to develop or validate the more complicated software needed for all-electronic systems.
