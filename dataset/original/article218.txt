217 most interfaces between users and computer systems involve the  equivalent  of  switchesâ€”keyboard  keys  or  mouse  but-tons.   These  interfaces  cannot  respond  to  degrees  of  pres-sure (for an exception  see gRaphicstablet).  Further  there is  no  feedback  returned  to  the  user  through  the  interface deviceâ€”the key or mouse does not â€œpush back. â€Haptic (from the greek word for â€œtouchâ€) interfaces are different in that they do register the pressure and motion of touch  and they often provide touch feedback as well.
