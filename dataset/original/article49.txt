48 Wary users have a number of ways to reduce their chance of being â€œphished. â€ Some signs of bogus messages include:  The message is addressed generically (â€œdear PayPal userâ€) or to the userâ€™s e-mail address rather than the account name.   The text of the message contains spelling errors or poor grammar.   The URL shown for a link in the message (perhaps via a â€œtool tipâ€) does not match the institutionâ€™s real Web address. Fortunately there are ways in which software can help detect and block most phishing attempts.  A good spam filter is the first line of defense and can block many phishing messages from getting to the user in the first place.  Anti-phishing features are also increasingly included in Web browsers  or available as plug-ins.  Thus â€œblacklistsâ€ of known phishing sites can be checked in real time and warnings given  or the siteâ€™s address can be blocked from access by the system.  Web sites can also introduce an added layer of security: Bank of America  for example  asks users to select and label one of several images offered by the bank.  The image and label are subsequent displayed as part of the log-in process.  If the user does not see the image and the userâ€™s label  then the site is presumably not the real bank site
