150 The essential core of the UNIX system is the kernel  which provides facilities to organize and access files    move data to and from devices  and control the running of programs (processes).  In designing UNIX  Thompson deliberately kept the kernel small  noting that he wanted maximum flexibility for users.  Since the kernel was the only part of the system that could not be reconfigured or replaced by the user  he limited it to those functions that reliability and efficiency dictated be handled at the system level. Another way in which the UNIX kernel was kept simple was through device independence.  This meant that instead of including specific instructions for operating particular models of terminal  printers  or plotters within the kernel  generic facilities were provided.  These could then be interfaced with device drivers and configuration files to control the particular devices. A UNIX system typically has many users  each of whom may be running a number of programs.  The interface that processes user commands is called the shell.  It is important to note that in UNIX a shell is just another program  so there can be (and are) many different shells reflecting varying tastes and purposes  .  Traditional UNIXshells include the Bourne shell (sh)  C shell (csh)  and Korn shell (ksh).  Modern UNIX systems can also have graphical user interfaces similar to those found on Windows and Macintosh personal computers  .
