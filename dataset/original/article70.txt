69 In 1921  the Czech playwright Karel Capek wrote a play called R. U. R.  or Rossumâ€™s Universal Robots.  Robot is a Czech word that has been translated as work(er)  serf  or slave.  In the play the robots  which are built by factories to work in other factories  eventually revolt against their human masters. During the 1960s  real robots began to appear in factory settings  .  They were an outgrowth of earlier machine tools that had been programmed by cams and other mechanisms.  An industrial robot is basically a movable arm that ends in a â€œhandâ€ called an end effector.  The arm and hand can be moved by some combination of hydraulic  pneumatic  electrical  or mechanical means.  Typical applications include assembling parts  welding  and painting.  The robot is programmed for a task either by giving it a detailed set of commands to move to  grasp  and manipulate objects  or by â€œtrainingâ€ the robot by moving its arm  hand  and effectors through the required motions  which are then stored in the robotâ€™s memory.  By the early 1970s  Unimation  Inc.  had created a profitable business from selling its Unimate robots to factories. The early industrial robots had very little ability to respond to variations in the environment  such as the â€œwork pieceâ€ that the robot was supposed to grasp being slightly out of position.  However  later models have more sophisticated sensors to enable them to adjust to variations and still accomplish the task.  The more sophisticated computer programs that control newer robots have internal representations or â€œframes of referenceâ€ to keep track of both the robotâ€™s internal parameters (angles  pressures  and so on) and external locations in the work area
