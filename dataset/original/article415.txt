414 When people think of a computer  they generally think of a general-purpose computing system housed in a separate box  for use on the desk or as a laptop or hand-held device.  However  the personal computer and its cousins are only the surface of a hidden web of computing capability that reaches deep into numerous devices used in our daily lives.  Modern cars  for example  often contain several specialized computer systems that monitor fuel injection or enhance the carâ€™s grip on the road under changing conditions.  Many kitchen appliances such as microwaves  dishwashers  and even toasters contain their own computer chips.  Communications systems ranging from cell phones to TV satellite dishes include embedded computers.  Most important  embedded systems are now essential to the operation of critical infrastructure such as medical monitoring systems and power transmission networks.  (The potential vulnerability of embedded systems to the Y2K date-related problems was a major concern in the months leading up to 2000  especially because many embedded systems might have to be replaced rather than just reprogrammed.  In the event  it turned out that there were relatively few date-dependent systems and only minor disruptions were experienced
