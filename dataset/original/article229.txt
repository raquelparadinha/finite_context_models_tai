228 The power of geographic information systems comes from the ability to integrate data from a variety of sources  whether aerial  photography   census  records   or  even  scanned  paper maps.  Once in digital form  the data can be represented in a variety of ways for various purposes.  A sophisticated gis can be  queried  to  determine   for  example   how  much  of  a  pro-posed  development  would  have  a  downhill  gradient  and  be below sea level such that flooding might be a problem.  These results can in turn be used by simulation programs to deter-mine   for  example   whether  release  of  a  chemical  into  the groundwater from a proposed plant site might affect a partic-ula r  town  two  miles  away.  geographic  information  systems are  thus  vital  for  the  management  of  a  variety  of  complex systems  that  are  distributed  over  a  geographical  area   such as water and sewage systems  power transmission grids  and traffic control systems.  Other applications include emergency planning (and evacuation routes) and the long-term study of the effects of global warming trends.
