225 A  genetic  program  consists  of  a  number  of  copies  of  a routine  that  contain  encoded  â€œgenesâ€  that  represent  ele-ments  of  algorithms.   The  routines  are  given  a  task  (such as  sorting  data  or  recognizing  patterns)  and  the  most  suc-cessful  routines  are  allowed  to  â€œreproduceâ€  by  exchanging genetic  material.   (Often   further  â€œmutationâ€  or  variation  is introduced  at  this  stage   to  increase  the  range  of  available solutions. )  The  new  â€œgenerationâ€  is  then  allowed  to  tackle the  problem   and  the  process  is  repeated.   As  a  result   the routines  become  increasingly  efficient  at  solving  the  given problem  just as organisms in nature become more perfectly adapted to a given environment.
