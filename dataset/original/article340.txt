339 Data Encryption Standard (DES) has been the most popular encryptionalgorithm of the past twenty-five years.  Originally developed at IBM Corporation  it was chosen by the USâ€™ National Bureau of Standards (NBS) asthe government-standard encryption algorithm in 1976.  Since then  it has become a domestic and international encryption standard  and has been used inthousands of applications.  Concerns about its short key length have doggedthe algorithm since the beginning  and in 1998 a brute-force machine capableof breaking DES was built.  Today  modifications to DES  such as triple-DES ensure that it will remain secure for the foreseeable future
