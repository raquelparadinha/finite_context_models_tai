259 The  ultimate  organization  of  data  in  a  file  depends  on  the application.   A  typical  approach  is  to  define  a  data  record with  various  fields.   The  program  might  have  a  loop  that repeatedly  requests  a  record  from  the  file   processes  it  in some  way   and  repeats  until  the  operating  system  tells  it that  it  has  reached  the  end  of  the  file.   This  would  be  a sequential  access;  a  program  can  also  be  set  up  for ran-dom  access   which  means  that  an  arbitrary  record  can  be requested  and  that  request  will  be  translated  into  the  cor-rect  physical  location  in  the  file.   The  two  approaches  can be combined in ISAm (Indexed Sequential Access method)  where  the  records  are  stored  sequentially  but  fields  are indexed so a particular record can be retrieved.
