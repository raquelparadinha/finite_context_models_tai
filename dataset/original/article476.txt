475 Smart cars are vehicles equipped with advanced computing and communication technologies that enable them to collect  analyze  and share data to provide a wide range of features and services.  These technologies include:Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS): Smart cars are equipped with a variety of sensors and cameras that enable ADAS features such as lane departure warning  automatic emergency braking  adaptive cruise control  and blind spot monitoring.  These features use computer algorithms to analyze data from the sensors and provide alerts or take action to prevent accidents. Connectivity: Smart cars are connected to the internet and other vehicles  enabling them to share data about traffic conditions  road hazards  and weather conditions.  This connectivity also allows for over-the-air software updates  remote diagnostics  and other services. Infotainment: Smart cars offer advanced infotainment systems that provide features such as internet connectivity  voice commands  music streaming  and navigation.  These systems are often integrated with the vehicle's ADAS features to provide real-time information and alerts. Self-driving: Some smart cars are capable of autonomous driving  using a combination of sensors  cameras  and computer algorithms to navigate roads without human intervention.  These cars are still in development and are not yet widely available. Energy Efficiency: Smart cars often use advanced technologies such as regenerative braking  stop-start systems  and aerodynamic designs to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.
