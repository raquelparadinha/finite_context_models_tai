121 Supercomputers are always more expensive and somewhat less reliable than standard computers  so they are used only when necessary.  As the power of standard computers continues to grow  applications that formerly required a multimillion-dollar supercomputer can now run on a desktop workstation (a good example is the creation of detailed 3D graphics). On the other hand  there are always applications that will soak up whatever computing power can be brought to bear on them.  These include analysis of new aircraft designs  weather and climate models  the study of nuclear reactions  and the creation of models for the synthesis of proteins.  The neverending battle of organizations such as the National Security Agency (NSA) to monitor worldwide communications and crack ever-tougher encryption also demands the fastest available supercomputers  .
