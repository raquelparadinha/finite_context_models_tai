433 Data integrity is related to data security  since the completeness and accuracy of data that has been compromised can no longer be guaranteed.  However  data integrity also requires the development and testing of procedures for the entry and verification of data (input) as well as verifying the accuracy of reports (output).  Database administrators may do some programming  but generally work with the programming staff in maintaining data integrity.  Since most data in computers ultimately comes from human beings  the training of operators is also important. Within the database structure itself  the links between data fields must be maintained (referential integrity) and a locking system must be employed to ensure that a new update is not processed while a pending one is incomplete  . Internal procedures and external regulations may require that a database be periodically audited for accuracy.  While this may be the province of a specially trained information processing auditor  it is often added to the duties of the database administrator
