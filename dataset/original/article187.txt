186 Starting in the 1980s  many organizations sought to connect their  employeesâ€™  desktop  computers  so  they  could  share central  databases   share  or  back  up  files   communicate  via e-mail   and  collaborate  on  projects.   A  system  that  links computers  within  a  single  office  or  home   or  a  larger  area such as a building or campus  is called a local area network (LAN).   (Larger  networks  linking  branches  of  an  organiza-tion  throughout  the  country  or  world  are  called  wide  area networks  or WANs.  See netWoRk. )
