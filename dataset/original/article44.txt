43 The PDF specifications are open source  so anyone canwrite software to create or read documents in the format. PDF includes three elements: a subset of the PostScript pagedescription language    a system for specifying and embedding common fonts (or referring to otherfonts)  and a system for â€œpackagingâ€ the text and graphicsdescriptions into a file in compressed form.  Later versionsof the PDF specification also allow users to interact withthe document  such as by filling in fields in a form or adding annotations to the text.  PDF also includes support fortags   and descriptors that can be used with programs such as screen readers for the blind. PDF also includes support for encrypting documents sothey can only be read with a password  and for controllingwhether the document can be copied or printed  though thisdepends on the userâ€™s software understanding and obeyingthe restrictions. Although creating and editing PDF documents originally required the relatively expensive Adobe Acrobat software  there are now a number of free or low-cost editorsand other PDF utilities for Windows  Mac OS X  and Linux/UNIX platforms.
