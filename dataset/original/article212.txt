211 The base 16 or hexadecimal system is a natural way to rep-resent the binary data stored in a computer.  It is more com-pact than binary because four binary digits can be replaced by a single â€œhexâ€ digit. The  following  table  gives  the  corresponding  decimal  binary  and hex values from 0 to 15:Note that decimal and hex digits are the same from 0 to 9   but  hex  uses  the  letters  Aâ€“F  to  represent  the  digits  cor-responding to decimal 10â€“15.  The system extends to higher numbers  using  increasing  powers  of  16   just  as  decimal uses  powers  of  10:  For  example   hex  FF  represents  binary 111  11111 or decimal 255.  many of the apparently arbitrary numbers encountered in programming can be better under-stood  if  one  realizes  that  they  correspond  to  convenient groupings of bits: FF is eight bits  sufficient to hold a single character  .  In low-level pro-gramming memory addresses are also usually given in hex
