239 JPEg   which  stands  for  Joint  Photographic  Experts group  is  widely  used  for  digital  cameras  because  of  its  ability  to highly  compress  the  data  in  a  color  graphics  image   allow-ing  a  reasonable  number  of  high-resolution  pictures  to  be stored  in  the  cameraâ€™s  onboard  memory.   The  compression is â€œlossy â€ meaning that information is lost during compres-sion  .  At relatively low compression ratios (such as 10:1  or 10 percent of the original image size) changes  in  the  image  due  to  data  loss  are  unlikely  to  be         graphics formatsperceived by the human eye.  At higher ratios (approaching 100:1)  the  image  becomes  seriously  degraded.   JPEgâ€™s  abil-ity to  store  thousands  of  colors  (unlike gIFâ€™s  limit  of  256) makes  the  format  particularly  suitable  for  the  subtleties  of photography.
