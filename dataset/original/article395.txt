394 Router is an interconnection device similar to a bridge but serves packets orframes containing certain protocols.  Hence  Routers link Local Area Networks (LANs) at the network layer. But with Home Users installing their own routers  Denial of Serive Attacks can become a nightmare.  For instance  in May 2003  the Universityof Wisconsinâ€“Madison found that it was the recipient of a continuous largescale flood of inbound Internet traffic destined for one of the campusâ€™ publicNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) servers.  The flood traffic rate was hundredsof-thousands of packets-per-second  and hundreds of megabits-per-second. The only recourse available to the University was to go to its ISP andasking it to null-route all this traffic to the university servers  meanwhilepaying a huge increase in bandwidth costsâ€”an increase that seriously hurtthe universityâ€™s IT budget  and would have quickly depleted it they ISP didnot respond by null-routing the traffic.
