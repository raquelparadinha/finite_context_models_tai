264 Because  of  their  frequent  use  to  share  copyrighted  music  video  or other material  a variety of organizations of copy-right  owners  have  sued  file-sharing  services  and/or  their users.   The  biggest  problem  for  the  courts  is  to  determine whether  there  is  â€œsubstantial  non-infringing  useâ€â€”that  is  the service is being used to exchange legal data. Some  file-sharing  services  have  been  accused  of  dis-tributing  malware  (viruses  or  spyware)  or  of  being  used to  distribute  material  that  is  illegal  per  se  (such  as  child pornography). In  response  to  litigation  threats   file-sharing  services have tended to become more decentralized  and some have features  that  increase  anonymity  of  users    or use encryption.
