430 Data acquisition systems are essential to gathering and processing the detailed data required by scientific and engineering applications.  The automated control of chemical or biochemical processes requires the ability of the control software to assess real-time physical data in order to make timely adjustments to such factors as temperature  pressure  and the presence of catalysts  inhibitors  or other components of the process.  The highly automated systems used in modern aviation and increasingly  even in ground vehicles  depend on real-time data acquisition.  It is not surprising  then  that data acquisition is one of the fastest-growing fields in computing
