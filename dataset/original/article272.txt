The arrows link each state (within a circle) to its possible successor.  In this simple example each digit must be followed by another digit until the fifth digit  which can either be followed by a blank (indi-cating a five-digit ZIP code) or four more digits for a 9-digit ZIP.         firewall       Hiding  all  the  internal  network  addresses  on  a  local network   presenting  only  a  single  address  to  the outside  world  (this  is  also  called  NAT   or  Network Address Translation)       monitoring  particular  applications  such  as  ftp  (file transfer  protocol)  and  telnet  (remote  login)   restrict-ing them to certain addresses.  Often a special address called  a  proxy  is  established  rather  than  allowing direct  connections  between  the  outside  and  the  local network.
