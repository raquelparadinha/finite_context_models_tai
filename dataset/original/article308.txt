307 Advisory and Notification Markup Language (ANML) is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) -based specification for describing advisories and other types of notifications.  ANML is currently being developed to help in solving the inconsistent use of terminology by software vendors in their advisories.  The hope is that ANML will make it easy for applications to read these advisories.  This will make way for the necessary tools to automatically update systems.  Although ANML will have its biggest impact for security advisories  it can be used for any type of notification.  Some examples include bug-fixes  feature enhancements  upgrade availability  and many more.  More information can be found in Appendix 1 (Opensec) and Appendix 6 under ADML
