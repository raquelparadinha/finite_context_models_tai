458 This concept involves the creation of a software system that runs programs and stores data across a number of different computers  an idea pervasive today.  A simple form is the central computer (such as in a bank or credit card company) with which thousands of terminals communicate to submit transactions.  While this system is in some sense distributed  it is not really decentralized.  Most of the work is done by the central computer  which is not dependent on the terminals for its own functioning.  However  responsibilities can be more evenly apportioned between computers  .
