57 The large computers that first became available in the 1950s   used â€œline printers. â€ These devices have one hammer for each column of the output.  A rapidly moving band of type moves under the hammers.  Each hammer strikes the band when the correct character passes by.  Printing is therefore done line by line  hence the name.  Line printers were fast (600 lines per minute or more) but like the mainframes they served  they were bulky and expensive. The typewriter offered another point of departure for designing printers.  A few early computers such as the BINAC (an offshoot of ENIAC) used typewriters rigged with magnetically controlled switches (solenoids).  However  a more natural fit was with the Teletype  invented early in the 20th century to print telegraph messages.  Since the Teletype is already designed to print from electrically transmitted character codes  it was easy to rig up a circuit to translate the contents of computer data into appropriate codes for printing.  (Since the Teletype could send as well as receive messages  it was often used as a control terminal for computer operators or for time-sharing computer users into the 1970s. )The daisy-wheel printer was another typewriter-like device.  It used a movable wheel with the letters embedded in slim â€œpetalsâ€ (hence the name).  It was slow (about 10 characters a second)  noisy  and expensive  but it was the only affordable alternative for early personal computer users who required â€œletter-qualityâ€ output.
