314 Backdoor is a hidden feature of an application prepared by its designer ormaintainers.  The backdoor gives the programmer special privileges for running the application.  These privileges are not available to the user. The motivation for such holes is not always sinister; some operating systemsâ€š for exampleâ€š come out of the box with privileged accounts intended foruse by field service technicians or the vendorâ€™s maintenance programmers. But we are not sure if such an account should be called backdoor â€“ in ourunderstandingâ€š backdoor is a hidden feature.  Yesâ€š these accounts were sometimes hiddenâ€š Microsoft NT 3. 51 and then they could be called backdoorsâ€šbut generally they are not hidden.
