190 Linux  is  an  increasingly  popular  alternative  to  proprietary operating systems.  Its development sprang from two sources.  First was the creation of open-source versions of UNIx utili-ties     by  maverick  programmer  Richard  Stallman as  part  of  the gNU  (â€œgnuâ€™s  not  UNIxâ€)  project  during  the 1980s.  Although these tools were useful  the kernel  or basic set of operating system functions  was still missing  .   Starting  in  1991   another  creative  programmer   Linus Torvalds  began to release open-source versions of the UNIx kernel   .   The  combination  of  the  ker-nel  and  utilities  became  known  as  Linux  (a  combination of Linus  and  UNIx)   though  Stallman  and  his  supporters believe that gNU/Linux is a more accurate name.
