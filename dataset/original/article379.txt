378 Mooreâ€™s Law is a theorem that states that the amount of information storableon a given amount of silicon has roughly doubled every year since the technology was invented.  First mentioned in 1964 by semiconductor engineerGordon Moore  co-founder of Intel in 1968  this held until the late 1970s at which point the doubling period slowed to 18 months.  Some are nowsuggesting that it is taking again 24â€“30 months.
