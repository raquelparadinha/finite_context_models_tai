498 Common Business-Oriented Language was developed under the impetus of a 1959 Department of Defense initiative to create a common language for developing business applications that centered on the processing of data from files.  (The military  after all  was a â€œbusinessâ€ whose inventory control and accounting needs dwarfed those of all but the largest corporations. ) At the time  the principal business-oriented language for mainframe computers was FLOW-MATIC  a language developed by Grace Hopperâ€™s team at RemingtonRand UNIVAC and limited to that companyâ€™s computers  .  The first COBOL compilers became available in 1960  and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) issued a standard specification for the language in 1968.  Expanded standards were issued in 1974 and 1985 (COBOL-74 and COBOL-85) with a new standard issued in 2002.
