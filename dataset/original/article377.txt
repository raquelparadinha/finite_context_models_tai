376 Logic Bombs (also called Fork Bombs) is a program or portion thereoffthat triggers or causes an application or operating system to perform whena certain logical event occurs.  The code may be used to recursively spawncopies of itself  thereby eventually eating all the process table entries andeffectively locking up the system  . A specific date  key combination  or internal counter are some of themost commonly used triggers that produce effects ranging from on-screendisplays to the blocking of the system or the deletion of files and programs. For instance  every day at 17:00 hours it mails out a message to 10 addressesout of a personâ€™s email address database  . A Virus may also no longer distribute itself after a certain date.  For instance the Sobig virus family expired September 10  2003 indicating that the writerwas primarily interested in studying the virusâ€™ effects on networks.  However this might change in the near future.
