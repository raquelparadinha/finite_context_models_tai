100 Besides the microprocessor and associated circuitry  the smart card contains a small amount of RAM (random access memory) to hold â€œscratchâ€ data during processing  as well as up to 64 kB of ROM (read-only memory) containing the cardâ€™s programming instructions.  The program is created on a desktop computer and written to the ROMthat is embedded in the card.  Finally  the card includes up to 64 kB of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) for holding account balances and other data.  This memory is nonvolatile (meaning that no power is needed to maintain it)  and can be erased and rewritten by the card reader. â€œContactâ€ cards must be swiped through the reader and are most commonly used in retail  phone  pay TV  or health care applications.  â€œContactlessâ€ cards need only be brought into the proximity of the reader  which communicates with it via radio signals or a low-powered laser beam.  Contactless cards are more practical for applications such as collecting bridge tolls  . The card reader (or terminal) at the point of sale contains its own computer  which runs software that requests particular services from the cardâ€™s program  including providing identifying information and balances  updating balances  and so on.
