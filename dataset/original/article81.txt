80 SAP has recognized for some time that while its base of large Fortune 500 companies has given it steady income  changing trends in business have been limiting the software giantâ€™s growth.  In particular  the trend has been toward smaller  simpler  more scalable applications that can be integrated with modern Web services.  In September 2007 SAP announced SAP Business ByDesign  a flexible set of enterprise management services that are delivered over the Web.  However  it remains to be seen how well SAP will be able to compete with more agile companies such as NetSuite and Salesforce. com  and whether the company will be able to upgrade its existing large company user base without disaffecting it. SAPâ€™s major competitor in the United States is Oracle    which has sued SAP in 2007 for unfairly downloading and using patches and support materials from Oracle and using them to support former Oracle customers.  SAP and Oracle have generally had quite different growth strategies: SAP grows by expanding and extending its own products  while Oracle has grown mainly through acquiring other companies.  However  in October 2007 SAP acquired Business Objects  a leader in â€œbusiness intelligenceâ€ systems  for $6. 8 billion.  This may signal SAPâ€™s willingness to engage in further strategic acquisitions
