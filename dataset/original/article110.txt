109 The bubble sort is based on making comparisons and swaps.  It makes the most convenient comparison possible: each record with its neighbor.  The algorithm looks at the first two records.  If the second has a lower key than the first  the records are swapped.  The procedure continues with the second and third records  then the third and fourth  and so on through all the records  swapping pairs of adjacent records whenever they are out of order.  After one pass the record with highest key will have â€œbubbled up toâ€ the end of the list.  The procedure is then repeated for all but the last record until the two highest records are at the end  and so on until all the records are sorted.  Unfortunately  the number of comparisons and swaps that must be made makes the bubble sort as slow as the selection sort.
