130 Tcl includes a number of extensions that  for example  provide access to popular database formats such as MySQL and can interface with other programming languages such as C++ and Java.  The most widely used extension is Tk  which provides a library for creating user interfaces for a variety of operating systems and languages such as Perl  Python  and Ruby. Tcl has been described as a â€œglueâ€ to connect existing applications.  It is relatively easy to write and test a script interactively (often at the command line)  and then insert it into the code of an application.  When the application runs  the Tcl interpreter runs the script  whose output can then be used by the main application
