88 By the mid-1990s  many thousands of pages were being added to the World Wide Web each day  .  The availability of graphical browsing programs such as Mosaic  Netscape  and Microsoft Internet Explorer   made it easy for ordinary PC users to view Web pages and to navigate from one page to another.  However  people who wanted to use the Web for any sort of systematic research found they needed better tools for finding the desired information. There are basically three approaches to exploring the Web: casual â€œsurfing â€ portals  and search engines.  A user might find (or hear about) an interesting Web page devoted to a business or other organization or perhaps a particular topic.  The page includes a number of featured links to other pages.  The user can follow any of those links to reach other pages that might be relevant.  Those pages are likely to have other interesting links that can be followed  and so on.  Most Web users have surfed in this way: It can be fun and it can certainly lead to â€œfindsâ€ that can be bookmarked for later reference.  However  this approach is not systematic  comprehensive  or efficient. Alternatively  the user can visit a site such as the famous Yahoo! started by Jerry Yang and David Filo  .  These sites specialize in selecting what their editors believe to be the best and most useful sites for each topic  and organizing them into a multilevel topical index.  The portal approach has several advantages: The work of sifting through the Web has already been done  the index is easy to use  and the sites featured are likely to be of good quality.  However  even Yahoo!â€™s busy staff can examine only a tiny portion of the estimated 1 trillion or so Web pages being presented on about 175 million different Web sites (as of 2008).  Also  the sites selected and featured by portals are subject both to editorial discretion (or bias) and in some cases to commercial interest.
