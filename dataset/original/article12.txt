11 Although it sounds similar  a storage area network (SAN) does not function as its own file server.  Rather  it attaches storage modules such as hard drives or tape libraries to an existing server so that it appears to the serverâ€™s operating system as though it were locally attached.  Typically the protocol used to attach the storage is SCSI    but the physical connection is fiber or high-speed Ethernet.  The emphasis for SAN applications is the need for fast access to data  such as in large online databases  e-mail servers  and high-volume file servers.  SANs offer great flexibility  since storage can be expanded without changing the network structure  and a replacement server can quickly be attached to the storage in case of hardware failure
