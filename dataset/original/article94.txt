93 The official standard for serial transmission is called RS232C.  It defines various additional pins to which wires are connected  such as for synchronization (specifying when the device is ready to send or receive data) and ground.  Physically  the old-style connectors are called DB-25 because they contain 25 pins (many of which are not used).  Most newer PCs have DB-9 (i. e.  nine pin) connectors.  A â€œgender changerâ€ can be used in cases where two devices both have male connectors (with pins) or female connectors (with corresponding sockets). Because they use a single data transmission line and include error-correction  serial cables can be longer than parallel cables (25 feet or more  as opposed to 10â€“12 feet).  Serial transmission is generally slower (at up to 115 200 bits/second) than parallel transmission.  Serial connections have generally been used for such devices as modems (whose speed is already limited by phone line characteristics)  keyboards  mice  and some older printers.  Today the faster and more flexible USB   is replacing serial connections for many devices including even keyboards
