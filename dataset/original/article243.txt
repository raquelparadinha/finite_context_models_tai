242 While conventional pointing devices   are quite satisfactory  for  making  selections  and  even  manipulat-ing  objects   many  artists  prefer  the  control  available  only through  a  pen  or  pencil   which  allows  the  angle  and  pres-sure of the stylus tip to be varied  creating precise lines and shading.  A graphics tablet (also called a digitizing tablet) is a device that uses a specially wired pen or pencil with a flat surface (tablet).  Besides tracking the location of the pen and tra  nslating  it  into x/Y  screen  coordinates   the  tablet  also has  pressure  sensors  (depending  on  sensitivity. the  tablet can recognize 256  512  or 1024 levels of pressure).  In com-bination with buttons on the pen  the pressure level can be used  to  control  the  line  thickness   transparency   or  color.  In  addition   the  driver  software  for  some  graphics  tablets includes additional functions such as the ability to program the  pen  to  control  features  of  such  applications  as  Adobe Photoshop.
