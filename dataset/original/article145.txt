144 As the name implies  a touchscreen is a screen display that can respond to various areas being touched or pressed.  Invented in 1971  the first form of touchscreens to become part of daily life were found on automatic teller machines (ATMs) and point-of-sale credit card processors. Touchscreens can detect the pressure of a finger or stylus in several ways: A â€œresistiveâ€ touchscreen uses two layers of electrically conductive metallic material separated by a space.  When an area is touched  the two layers are electrically connected  and the change in electrical current is registered and converted to a code that identifies the location touched.  Surface acoustic wave (SAW) touchscreens use an ultrasonic wave that is interrupted by a touch; capacitive touchscreens respond to the change in electron storage (capacitance) caused by contact with a human body.  Various other acoustic  mechanical (strain-based)  or optical systems can also be used  with the latter being particularly popular
