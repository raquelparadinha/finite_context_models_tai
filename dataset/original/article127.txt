126 As the name suggests  a tablet PC is a small computer about the size of a notebook (not to be confused with a â€œnotebook PC â€ which is a small  light laptop).  The user can write on the screen with a stylus to take notes (for similar functionality  see graphics tablet)  draw  and make selections with stylus or fingertip. If the user writes on the screen  software converts the writing to the appropriate characters and stores them in a file  .  As with some PDAs  there may also be a system of shorthand â€œgesturesâ€ that can be used to write more quickly.  Alternatively  the user can type with stylus or fingertips on a â€œvirtual keyboardâ€ displayed on the screen  . A more versatile and natural interface is becoming available: â€œmultitouch â€ pioneered by the Apple iPhone and Microsoft Surface  can recognize multiple motions and pressure points simultaneously.  This allows the user to  for example  flick the finger to â€œturn a pageâ€ or use a pinching motion to â€œpick upâ€ an object. Applications for tablet PCs include many PDA-type applications    field note taking  inventory  and other tasks that require a device that is not encumbering.  Because of its compactness  a tablet PC can also be a good reader for ebooks  .
