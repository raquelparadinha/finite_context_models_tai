245 In recent years the disposal of obsolete computers and other electronic  equipment  (â€œe-wasteâ€)  has  been  both  a  grow-ing  concern  and  a  business  opportunity.   There  are  many toxic substances in electronics components  including lead  mercury   and  cadmium.   Processing  e-waste  to  recover  raw materials is expensive  so greater emphasis has been placed on  disassembling  machines  and  reusing  or  refurbishing their  individual  components.  meanwhile   many  communi-ties have banned disposing of e-waste in regular trash  and some have offered opportunities to drop off e-waste at no or minimal  charge.   States  such  as  California  have  also  insti-tuted  a  recycling  fee  that  is  collected  upon  sale  of  devices such as CRT monitors and televisions.
