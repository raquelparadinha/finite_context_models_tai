422 An important characteristic of quality software is its ability to handle errors that arise in processing (also called run-time errors or â€œexceptionsâ€).  Before it is released for general use  a program should be thoroughly tested with a variety of input  .  When errors are found  the soundness of the algorithm and its implementation must be checked  as well as the program logic  .  Interaction between the program and other programs (including the operating system) as well as with hardware must also be considered.  (See bugsand debugging. )However  even well-tested software is likely to encounter errors.  Therefore a program intended for widespread use must include instructions for dealing with errors  anticipated or otherwise.  The process of error handling can be divided into four stages: validation  detection  communication  and amelioration.
