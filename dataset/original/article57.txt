56 Whether at a business meeting or a scientific conference  the use of slides or transparencies has been largely replaced by software that can create a graphic presentation.  Generally  the user creates a series of virtual â€œslides â€ which can consist of text (such as bullet points) and charts or other graphics.  Often there are templates already structured for various types of presentations  so the user only needs to supply the appropriate text or graphics.  There are a variety of options for the general visual style  as well as for transitions (such as dissolves) between slides.  Another useful feature is the ability to time the presentation and provide cues for the speaker.  Finished presentations can be shown on a standard monitor screen (if the audience is small) or output to a screen projectorMicrosoft PowerPoint is the most widely used presentation program.  It includes the ability to import Excel spreadsheets  Word documents  or other items created by Microsoft Office suite applications.  The user can switch between outline view (which shows the overall structure of the presentation) to viewing individual slides or working with the slides as a collection. There are a number of alternatives available including Appleâ€™s Keynote and Open Office  which includes a presentation program comparable to PowerPoint.  Another alternative is to use HTML Web-authoring programs to create the presentation in the form of a set of linked Web pages.  (PowerPoint and other presentation packages can also convert their presentations to HTML. ) Although creating presentations in HTML may be more difficult than using a proprietary package and the results may be somewhat less polished  the universality of HTML and the ability to run presentations from a Web site are strong advantages of that approach.
