492 In personal computers a chipset is a group of integrated circuits that together perform a particular function.  System purchasers generally think in terms of the processor itself (such as a Pentium III  Pentium IV  or competitive chips from AMD or Cyrix).  However they are really buying a system chipset that includes the microprocessor itself   and often a memory cache (which may be part of the microprocessor or a separate chipâ€”see cache) as well as the chips that control the memory bus (which connects the processor to the main memory on the motherboardâ€”see bus. ) The overall performance of the system depends not just on the processorâ€™s architecture (including data width  instruction set  and use of instruction pipelines) but also on the type and size of the cache memory  the memory bus (RDRAM or â€œRambusâ€ and SDRAM) and the speed with which the processor can move data to and from memory. In addition to the system chipset  other chipsets on the motherboard are used to support functions such as graphics (the AGP  or Advanced Graphics Port  for example)  drive connection (EIDE controller)  communication with external devices    and connections to expansion cards (the PCI bus).
