287 many  computer  users  are  familiar  with  the  colorful  fractal patterns  generated  by  some  screen  savers.   There  are  hun-dreds  of  â€œfamiliesâ€  of  fractals  (beginning  with  the  famous mandelbrot  set)  that  can  be  color-coded  and  displayed  in endless  detail.   But  there  are  a  number  of  more  significant applications.   Because  of  their  ability  to  generate  realistic textures at every level of detail  many computer games and simulations  use  fractals  to  generate  terrain  interactively.  Fractals  can  also  be  used  to  compress  large  digital  images into  a  much  smaller  equivalent  by  creating  a  mathemati-cal  transformation  that  preserves  (and  can  be  used  to  re-cre  ate)  the  essential  characteristics  of  the  image.  military experts can use fractal analysis either to distinguish artifi-cial  objects  from  surrounding  terrain  or  camouflage   or  to generate more realistic camouflage.  Fractals and chaos the-ory are likely to produce many surprising discoveries in the future  in areas ranging from signal analysis and encryption to economic forecasting.
