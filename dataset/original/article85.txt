84 These general principles also apply to systems where more than one processor is available    but there is the added complication of deciding where the scheduling program will be run.  In a multiprocessing system that has one â€œmasterâ€ and many â€œslaveâ€ processors  the scheduling program runs on the master processor.  This arrangement is simple  but it means that when a slave processor wants to schedule a program it must wait until the scheduling program gets its next time-slice on the master processor. One alternative is to allow any processor that has free time to run the scheduling algorithm.  This is harder to set up because it requires a mechanism to make sure two processors do not try to run the scheduling program at the same time  but it smoothes out the bottleneck that would arise from relying on a single processor.
