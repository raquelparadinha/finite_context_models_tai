158 Besides military training  currently the most viable application for VR seems to be entertainment.  VR techniques have been used to create immersive experiences in elaborate facilities at venues such as Disneyland and Universal Studios  and to some extent even in local arcades.  VR that is accompanied by convincing physical sensations has allowed for the creation of a new generation of roller coasters that if built physically would be too expensive  too dangerous  or even physically impossible. However  there are other significant emerging applications for VR.  When combined with telerobotic technology    VR techniques are already being used to allow surgeons to perform operations in new ways.  VR technology can also be used to make remote conferencing more realistic and satisfactory for participants.  Clearly the potential uses for VR for education and training in many different fields are endless.  VR technology combined with robotics could also be used to give disabled persons much greater ability to carry out the tasks of daily life. In the ultimate VR system  users will be networked and able to simultaneously experience the environment  interacting both with it and one another.  The technical resources and programming challenges are also much greater for such applications.  The result  however  might well be the sort of environment depicted by science fiction writers such as William Gibson
