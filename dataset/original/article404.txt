403 P2P Spoofing means that an attacker could have anonymously tricked aninnocent P2P user into downloading a contraband file from another user onthe P2P network.  This can occur by having an attacker modify search requestsand search results in transit by  for instance  placing the innocent userâ€™s IPaddress in the search result packet that lists a contraband file.  Another waymight be whereby a search request for music has a hop count set to 255.  Theflawed P2P application permits the attacker to set the hop count value backto zero  thereby making the innocent user be seen as the originator.  Changingthe search string church hymns to Rolling Stones makes an authority assumethat the innocent user went out to search for illegal content. The difficulties for authorities is to prove that the apparent offender wasthe actual offender  in turn this would require that the agency proofs that therewere no malicious users on the P2P network at the time while the apparentoffenderâ€™s P2P application had no implementation flaws that are possible.
