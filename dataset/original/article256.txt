255 Optical  fiber  in  its  modern  form  was  developed  in  the 1950s.   The  glass  fiber  through  which  the  light  passes  is surrounded  by  a  transparent  cladding  designed  to  provide the needed refractive index to keep the light confined.  The cladding  in  turn  is  surrounded  by  a  resin  buffer  layer  and often an outer jacket and plastic cover.  Fiber used for com-munication is flexible  allowing it to bend if necessary. Early  optical  fiber  could  not  be  used  for  practical  com-munication because of progressive attenuation (weakening) of the light as it traveled.  However  by the 1970s the attenu-ation  was  being  reduced  to  acceptable  levels  by  removing impurities from the fibers.  Today the light signals can travel hundreds of miles without the need for repeaters or amplifi-ers.  In the 1990s a new type of optical fiber (photonic crys-tal)  using  diffraction  became  available.   This  kind  of  fiber is  particularly  useful  in  applications  that  require  higher power signals.
