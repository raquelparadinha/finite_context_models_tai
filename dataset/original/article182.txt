181 NLP is a multidisciplinary field that draws from linguis-tics and computer science  particularly artificial intelligence  .  In terms of linguistics  a program must be able to deal with words that have multiple mean-ings (â€œwind up the clockâ€ and â€œthe wind is cold todayâ€) as well as grammatical ambiguities (in the phrase â€œlittle girlâ€™s schoolâ€ is it the school that is little  the girls  or both?).  Of course each language has its own forms of ambiguity. Programs can use several strategies for dealing with these problems  including using statistical models to predict the likely meaning of a given phrase based on a â€œcorpusâ€ of existing text in that language  . As formidable as the task of extracting the correct (lit-eral) meaning from text can be  it is really only the first level of natural language processing.  If a program is to success-fully summarize or draw conclusions about a news report from North Korea  for example  it would also have to have a knowledge base of facts about that country and/or a set of â€œframesâ€   about how to interpret vari-ous situations such as threat  bluff  or compromise. )
