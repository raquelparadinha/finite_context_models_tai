46 When modern digital computing emerged in the 1940s  it evolved from two roots: engineering (particularly electrical engineering) and mathematics.  The goals of the earliest computer designers were focused naturally enough on computing  although several early thinkers   had already begun to think of computers as symbol-processing and knowledgeretrieving machines  not just number crunchers. As computer scientists began to become more concerned about the structure of data and the modeling of real-world objects in computer languages    they began to wrestle with some areas long familiar to philosophers.  As data structure involved into knowledge representations  epistemology (the philosophical investigation of the meaning and accessibility of knowledge) became more relevant  particularly in developing systems for artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Also relevant is ontology (the nature and relationship of entitiesâ€”see ontologies and data models)  particularly with regard to the modern effort to encode relationships between items of knowledge into Web pages
