16 Numbers with a fractional (decimal) part are usually storedin a format called floating point.  The â€œfloatingâ€ means thatthe location of the decimal point can be moved as necessaryto fit the number within the specified digit range.  A floatingpoint number is actually stored in four separate parts.  Firstcomes the sign  indicating whether the number is negativeor positive.  Next comes the mantissa  which contains theactual digits of the number  both before and after the decimal point.  The radix is the â€œbaseâ€ for the number systemused.  Finally  the exponent determines where the decimalpoint will be placed. For example  the base 10 number 247. 35 could be represented as 24735 Ã— 10-2.  The -2 moves the decimal pointat the end two places to the left.  However  floating-pointnumbers are normalized to a form in which there is just onedigit to the left of the decimal point.  Thus  247. 35 wouldactually be written 2. 4735 Ã— 102.  This system is also knownas scientific notation. As noted earlier  actual data storage in modern computers is always in binary  but the same principle applies. According to IEEE Standard 754  32-bit floating-point numbers use 1 bit for the sign  8 bits for the exponent  and 23bits for the mantissa (also called the significand  since itexpressed the digits that are significantâ€”that is  guaranteed not to be â€œlostâ€ through overflow or underflow in processing).  The double precision float  declared as a â€œdoubleâ€in C programs  uses 1  11  and 52 bits respectively.
