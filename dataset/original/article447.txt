446 A decision support system (DSS) is a computer application that focuses on providing access to or analysis of the key information needed to make decisions  particularly in business.  (It can be thought of as a more narrowly focused approach to computer assistance to managementâ€”see management information system. )The development of DSS has several roots reaching back to the 1950s.  This includes operational analysis and the theory of organizations and the development of the first interactive (rather than batch-processing) computer systems.  Indeed  the SAGE automated air defense system developed starting in the 1950s could be described as a military DSS.  The system presented real-time information (radar plots) and enabled the operator to select and focus on particular elements using a light pen.  By the 1960s more-systematic research on DSS was underway and included the provocative idea of â€œhuman-computer symbiosisâ€ for problem solving  .
