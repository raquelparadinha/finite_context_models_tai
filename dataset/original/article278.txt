277 A flash or â€œthumbâ€ drive is a small data storage device that uses semiconductor flash memory rather than a disk drive.  It is connected to a digital device using the universal serial bus   .   Because  most  computers   digital  cameras  and  other  digital  devices  have  USB  ports   a  flash  drive  is  a convenient way to provide up to 16 gB (as of 2007) of low power   rewritable  memory.   Flash  drives  first  appeared  in late 2000. Flash drives can use a separate USB cable (useful when several devices need to be connected to closely spaced USB ports)  or  simply  have  a  connector  that  plugs  directly  into the port.  many  people  who  regularly  work  with  several computers carry their backup data or even a complete oper-ating system (such as Linux) on a flash drive  perhaps con-nected to their keyring.
