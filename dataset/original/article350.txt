349 The Domain Name System (DNS) is the Internet's system for mapping alphabetic names to numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses like a phone book maps a person's name to a phone number.  For example  when a Web address (URL) is typed into a browser  a DNS query is made to learn an IP address of a Web server associated with that name. Using the www. example. com URL  example. com is the domain name  and www is the hostname.  DNS resolution maps www. example. com into an IP address (such as 192. 0. 2. 1).  When a user needs to load a webpage  a conversion must occur between what a user types into their web browser (www. example. com) into an IP address required to locate the www. example. com site. The DNS system is an open worldwide network of database name servers that include 13 authoritative name servers that serve the DNS root zone level  known as root servers.  A root server (also called a DNS root nameserver) receives a DNS query that includes a domain name (e. g.  www. thousandeyes. com)  and responds by directing that request to a top-level domain (TLD) nameserver  based on the TLD of that domain such as . com  . net  and . org.  It directly responds to requests for DNS records in the root zone by returning an appropriate list of the authoritative TLD name servers for the appropriate TLD that can resolve the initial DNS lookup request for an IP address of that domain name.
