489 The famous Turing test   proposes that if a human is unable to reliably distinguish messages from a computer from those of another person  the computer program involved can at least be provisionally declared to be â€œintelligent. â€ The advent of textual communication via the Internet   has afforded a variety of ways to attempt to meet this challenge.  Programs that mimic human conversational styles have come to be known as â€œchatterbots. â€The prototypical chatterbot was ELIZA  developed by Joseph Weizenbaum in the mid-1960s  .  ELIZA mimicked a form of nondirective psychotherapy in which the therapist echoes or plays off of the clientâ€™s statements as a form of gentle encouragement and validation.  Thus if one types  â€œMy father didnâ€™t really like me â€ ELIZA might reply  â€œTell me more about your father. â€ Although primitive  ELIZA once inadvertently fooled an executive into thinking he was exchanging messages with Weizenbaum.  Other classic chatterbots include Parry  designed to mimic a paranoid  and the story-generating Racter.
