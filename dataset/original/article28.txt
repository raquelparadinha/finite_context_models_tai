Players can spend hundredsof hours helping their characters develop skills  increasingtheir levels through experience points gained from successful combat or other activities.  Players (and their characters) frequently form organizations such as guilds or clans because the tougher challenges generally require the cooperation of different types of classes of characters (fighters healers  and magic-users). Modern MM ORPGs began in the late 1990s with suchtitles as Ultima Online and EverQuest.  The most popularMMORPG in the mid-2000s was World of Warcraft.
