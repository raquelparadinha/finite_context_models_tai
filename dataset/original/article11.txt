10 A network attached storage (NAS) unit can be thought of as a dedicated data storage unit that is available to all users of a network.  Unlike a traditional dedicated file storage unit    a NAS unit typically has an operating system and software designed specifically (and only) for providing data storage services.  The actual storage is usually provided by an array of hard drives  .  Files on the NAS are accessed through protocols such as SMB (server message block)  common on Windows networks  and NFS (network file system)  used on many UNIX and some Linux networks.  In recent years smaller  lower-cost NAS devices have become available for smaller networks  including home networks  where they can store music  video  and other files
