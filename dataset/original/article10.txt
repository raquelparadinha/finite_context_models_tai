9 According to the OSI (open systems interconnection) model  a network can be considered to be a series of seven layers laid one atop another  . The physical layer is at the bottom.  It specifies the physical connections between the computers  which can be anything from ordinary phone lines to cable  fiber optic  or wireless.  This layer specifies the required electrical characteristics (such as voltage changes and durations that constitute the physical signal that is recognized as either a 1 or 0 in the â€œbit stream. â€The next layer  called the data link layer  specifies how data will be grouped into chunks of bits (frames or packets) and how transmission errors will be dealt with  . The network layer groups the data frames as parts of a properly formed data packet and routes that packet from the sending node to the specified destination node.  A variety of routing algorithms can be used to determine the most efficient route given current traffic or line conditions. The transport layer views the packets as part of a complete transmission of an object (such as a Web page) and ensures that all the packets belonging to that object are sorted into their original sequence at the destination.  This is necessary because packets belonging to the same message may be sent via different routes in keeping with traffic or line conditions. The session layer provides application programs communicating over the network with the ability to initiate  terminate  or restart an interrupted data transfer. The presentation layer ensures that data formats are consistent so that all applications know what to expect.  This layer can also provide special services  . Finally  the application layer gives applications highlevel commands for performing tasks over the network  such as file transfer protocol (ftp)
