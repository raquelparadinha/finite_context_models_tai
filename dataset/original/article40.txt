OS X10. 5 also includes Time Machine an automatic backup system that can restore files (includingdeleted files) as well as earlier system settings. For software developers  OS X provides an integrateddevelopment environment called â€œXcode â€ which workswith modified open-source compilers for major programming languages  including C  C++  and Java.  Further because OS X is UNIX-based  many UNIX and Linux programs can be recompiled to run on it.  Since mid-2005 Apple(and OS X) have been transitioning from the earlier IBM/Motorola processors to Intel processors.  This transition waslargely complete by 2007  though OS X 10. 5 (Leopard) stillprovides support for applications written for the PowerPC. OS X has been well received by critics  and together withits bundled software has made the Macintosh a popularplatform for users who want a seamless computing experience  particularly with regard to graphics and media.
