134 Many technical writers work within software companies or in the information systems departments of other corporations  universities  or government agencies.  Their work is generally more highly structured than that of the manual or book writer.  As part of a development team  a technical writer may be in charge of creating documentation describing the data structures  classes  and functions within the program.  This task is aided by a variety of tools including facilities for extracting such information automatically from C++ or Java programs.  The writer may also be responsible for maintaining logs that show each change or addition made to the program during each compiled version or â€œbuild. â€This type of technical writing requires detailed knowledge of operating systems  programming languages  software development tools  and software engineering methodology.  It also requires the ability to work well as part of a team  often under conditions of high pressure.
