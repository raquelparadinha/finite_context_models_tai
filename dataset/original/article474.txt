473 Development of automotive technology has tended to be incremental rather than revolutionary.  The core â€œhardwareâ€ such as the engine and drive train has changed little over several decades  other than the replacement of carburetors with fuel injection systems  and some improvements in areas such as brake design.  On the other hand there have been significant improvements in safety features such as seat belts  air bags  and improved crash absorption barriers. In recent years  however  the incorporation of computers in automobile design   has led to a number of significant advances in areas such as fuel efficiency  traction/stability  crash response  and driver information and navigation.  Put simply  cars are becoming â€œsmarterâ€ and are making driving easier and safer
