116 Spyware and adware are two pervasive threats to computer users.  Both are programs that are installed more or less surreptitiously  often accompanying an attractive-looking â€œfreeâ€ software package or media download.  Depending on how widely it is defined  as many as eight out of 10 PCs may be infected by some sort of spyware.  Signs of infection can include the system slowing down or periodically freezing  Web browsers that fail to display the expected home page or search results  and the appearance of numerous unwanted pop-up windows (a sign of adware). Ranging from least to most harmful  spyware and adware can do the following:  Display annoying advertising that can clog up the screen or cover up information (some adware can also be spyware that uses information about the user to target advertising)  Track Web browsing to provide information to sell to marketers    Obtain personal information for use in identity theft  Install keyloggers (programs that record keystrokes  such as passwords being entered) or other â€œback doorâ€ or â€œtrojanâ€ programs
