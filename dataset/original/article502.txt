501 With the exception of a few experimental systems  color graphics first became widely available only with the beginnings of desktop computers in the late 1970s.  The first microcomputers were able to display only a few colors (some  indeed  displayed only monochrome or grayscale).  Todayâ€™s PC video hardware has the potential to display millions of colors  though of course the human eye cannot directly distinguish colors that are too close together.  There are several important schemes that are used to define a â€œcolor spaceâ€â€”that is  a range of values that can be associated with physical colors.
