251 Fault  tolerance  is  a  design  concept  that  recognizes  that  all computer-based systems will fail eventually.  The question is whether a system as a whole can be designed to â€œfail grace-fully. â€  This  means  that  even  if  one  or  more  components fail   the  system  will  continue  to  operate  according  to  its design  specifications   even  if  its  speed  or  throughput  must decrease.
