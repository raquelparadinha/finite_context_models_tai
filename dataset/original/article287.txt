286 Fractals  and  the  related  idea  of  chaos  have  profoundly changed  the  way  scientists  think  about  and  model  the world.   Around  1960   Benoit mandelbrot  noticed  that  sup-posedly random economic fluctuations were not distributed evenly but tended to form â€œclumps. â€ As he investigated other sources of data  he found that many other things exhibited this  odd  behavior.   He  also  discovered  that  the  patterns  of distribution were â€œself-similarâ€â€”that is  if you magnified a portion of the pattern it looked like a miniature copy of the whol  e.   mandelbrot  coined  the  term fractal  (meaning  frac-tured  or broken up) to describe such patterns.  Eventually  a  number  of  simple  mathematical  functions  were  found  to exhibit such behavior in generating values.
