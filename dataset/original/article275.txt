274 A flag is a variable that is used to specify a particular condi-tion or status  .  Usually a flag is either true or false.   For  example   a  flag  Valid_Form  could  be  set  to  true before  the  input  form  is  processed.   If  the  validation  check for  any  data  field  fails   the  flag  would  be  set  to  false.   After the  input  procedure  has  ended   the  main  program  would check the Valid_Form flag.  If itâ€™s true  the data on the form is  processed  (for  example   continuing  on  to  the  payment process).  If the flag is false  the input form might be redis-played with errors or omissions highlighted.
