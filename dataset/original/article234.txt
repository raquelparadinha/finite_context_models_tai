233 prior  to  the  late  1970s   most  computer  applications  (other than  some  scientific  and  experimental  ones)  did  not  use graphics.   However   the  early  microcomputer  systems  such as the Apple II  Radio Shack TRS-80  and Commodore PET could all display graphics  either on a monitor or (with the aid  of  a  video  modulator)  on  an  ordinary  TV  set.   While primitive (low resolution; monochrome or just a handful of colors)  this  graphics  capability  allowed  for  a  thriving  mar-ket in games and educational software. The  earliest  video  displays  for  mainstream  PCs  pro-vid ed basic text display capabilities (such as the mDA  or monochrome  display  adapter   with  25  lines  of  text  up  to 80  characters  per  line)  plus  the  ability  to  create  graphics by setting the color of individual pixels.  The typical low-endgraphics card of the early 1980s was the CgA (Color graphics  Adapter)   which  offered  various  modes  such  as 320  by  200  pixels  with  four  colors.   Computers  marketed forprofessional  use  offered  the  EgA  (Enhanced graph-ics  Adapter)   which  could  show  640  by  350  pixels  at  16 colors.
