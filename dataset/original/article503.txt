502 One of the simplest color systems displays colors as varying intensities of red  green  and blue.  This corresponds to the electronics of a standard color computer monitor  which uses three electron guns that bombard red  green  and blue phosphors on the screen.  A typical RGB color scheme uses 8 bits to store each of the red  green  and blue components for each pixel  for a total of 24 bits (16 777 216 colors).  The 32-bit color system provides the same number of colors but includes 8 bits for alpha  or the level of transparency.  The number of bits per pixel is also called the bit depth or color depth
