Well to start with, they need to keep the most popular one by elections because it would be fair to people to have the electoral votes. Its absolutely a great idea in my preside ! I think that people should vote on what they want to do not the senate or house of the United States. Also, it seems to me that the votes keep going down because people don't like the way they have to vote it's going astronomical they need to take control NOW ! Even though candidates might now want to spend time going through the headache of focusing on because to me it's the most basic level and it is UNFAIR to all voters all around the globe. Although my opinion is people need to realize to some overruled voters are all not electoral college don't mean you cannot vote for regular it's entirely impossible for the "new president" not to win and that's one reason why people pick that source because they know for a fact that they all win their president they voted for this on coming "election". ALL votes go to the house / state senate, and it goes uphill from there so according to the passage all the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have a regional appeal. But in 2012 President Park Obama almost didn't make president until they put the electoral votes all together, and we won PRESIDENT !! But of course knowing your vote you need to have to pay attrition to the campaign that the presidency were picked by a popular more VOTE. Even though votes swing on a national election one and a half Americans express a temperance than an actual single vote which is probably much faster and easier on us and the senate. Knowing that people want to make sure our country stays in place they vote the correct president for the next four years so make the correct decision.
