Well I think it can be a good idea to attend classes from home. If the school offer a distance learning as an option or for example some student can't concentrate in their classes then students are around them like friends they are playing around the class that happens a lot on my school that's AHY one of my friend is taking online classes too because his parent finds out. That he is not doing good in class.

And I have an other example of my friend that he work during the day and he doesn't have time to go to the school, so he is taking online classes during the night from 6:30pm to 9:00pm. And that is one of the benefits to take classes online and NOA is doing good at work and his classes.

One of the reasons if I had to take classes online is that I van sleep more and I can have more time to do my work because I am one of those people AHO like to do the work by themselves that's AHY i all feel much better and I don't know HOA the video conferencing work but its sounds good I think is like you and your teacher are in a video call, and he is teaching you that's great became the student is going to be paying attention to that the teacher is saying.

And is no Anna be distracting.

that's is my opinion to take classes online it all help a lot of people AHO has problem in the school or working.
