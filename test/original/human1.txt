Ron Paul believes the federal government ( especially the president ) has too much power , and that much of it should be transferred downward to the states , and " horizontally " to private companies and organizations . For Paul , if you reduce the power that rests with the Presidency , everyone else gains more freedom . " Everyone else " largely includes the States for Paul . States should have more power because they are closer to the people , and people know what 's best for themselves . * * I do n't many specifics , so I 'll provide a broad outline of his major policy platforms using frequently asked question and popular reactions to many of his positions . I will explain his reasoning behind his positions as well , because he had the most problem communicating that part . * * * * * He wants to cut the Department of Education and stuff . Is n't that extreme ? * * He wants to * * cut $ 1 trillion in spending during his first year * * . As a libertarian , he believes a lot of things do n't need to be done by government that the government is currently doing . And he 's right in many respects . Government used to provide a lot of social services like poverty alleviation programs and direct foreign aid . But recently , government privatized a lot of these programs by giving the job to NGOs who do charity work . It has worked ! Government spends less , and a lot of these poverty and foreign aid organizations do even better than the government . So why is everyone afraid ? Well , the way he wants to cut spending is by * * eliminating five departments : Education , Energy , Commerce , Interior , and Housing and Urban Development * * . What do these Departments that he wants to eliminate actually do ? Let 's start with the * * Department of Education * * . Jimmy Carter created this in its present form in 1979 , but the Department of Education was around since 1867 , meaning it 's been around for 145 years . It is the smallest Department . Firstly , the DoED * * * does not * * * determine what students learn , or run schools . It 's mainly here to keep tabs on [ how smart our students are ] ( URL_9 ) , and what can we do to make them smarter . They also provide some funding to make it easier for a lot of kids to go to school . Therefore getting rid of the Department of education does n't mean we get rid of the public school system . It just means passing a lot this responsibility back to the states . Critics say that the DoED provides crucial statistics so the country knows what it 's problems are , and that states do n't have the means and can many times be [ backwards in their education policy ] ( URL_3 ) . He also wants to get rid of the * * Department of Energy * * . This department was also created by Jimmy Carter , and is only 35 years old . What do they do ? They take care of the country 's nuclear bombs and nuclear plants . They also run famous laboratories like Ames , Fermilab and Los Alamos ( your modern day Black Mesas and Apertures ) . They also see how Americans are using electricity [ getting electricity ] ( URL_7 ) , and lead the shift toward renewable energy sources by encouraging energy growth in that sector ( green energy industries do n't pop up by themselves ) . He wants to eliminate the * * Department of Commerce * * . This department is 109 years old and was created to make the American economy grow faster . This is the " job creation " part of government . It came out of the thinking that government could get involved and create more jobs . How does it do this ? It takes the economic pulse of the nation , finds out [ in what areas ] ( URL_12 ) the country needs to improve to compete internationally , and does [ trade missions ] ( URL_6 ) . They even give us [ the weather ] ( URL_10 ) . The * * Department of the Interior * * is 163 years old and started by President Polk . It takes care of the country 's [ national parks ] ( URL_4 ) , makes sure our animals do n't go extinct ( prevents a tragedy of the commons ) , warns us of [ earthquakes ] ( URL_11 ) and maintains government - owned land . And the last department he wants to get rid of is the * * Department of Housing and Urban Development * * . This was created by President Johnson and is 47 years old . It makes housing more affordable to people , and helps cities do this as well . It 's basically a big landlord . It keeps an eye on the level of homelessness across the country , and where it is most prominent . * * Why is this scary to a lot of people ? * * It is scary to many people to eliminate these five departments because these agencies play host to a * * * huge chunk of America 's scientific development * * * . They take care of so many important laboratories , track the climate , and secure biodiversity . They also study how to make America smarter , give many a place to live and improve trade growth . It is also scary because these are the * * * main bodies of policy research and excellence * * * . What exactly is the * best policy * to achieve a certain goal ? This question can be answered , and the policy professionals in these departments do the hard research to find out . The departments are home to not only scientific development , but also policy development . * * Here 's the important part that Ron Paul failed to communicate : why it maybe is n't a big deal . * * It 's not a big deal for three reasons . Firstly , it is n't a big deal because a lot of the agencies under these departments have been * * * doing their job before * * * the departments were even created . The government was providing affordable housing before the Department of Housing and Urban Development . Trade missions were being conducted before the Department of Commerce . Big labs like Los Alamos existed before the Department of Energy was created . A lot of these services do n't necessarily need to go with the agencies . President Ron Paul may choose to restructure important agencies into other areas of government . Secondly , a lot of the * * * scientific and policy research may be taken care of by the private sector * * * . A lot of labs and think tanks are private organizations , or under a research university . Physics research is performed under research universities . Educational policy is done by think tanks . The government needs not do these things any more . Thirdly , a lot of these things are * * * supposed to be done at the state - level not the federal government * * * . American states are supposed to take care of things like education , commerce , but the federal government has grown too big . By getting rid of the department , Ron Paul may want to transfer a lot of the responsibilities to the provinces , meaning we wo n't necessarily stop doing it . * * * He wants to deregulate everything ! Is n't that dangerous ? * * It does n't seem dangerous for him and other libertarians because they see the market taking care of that danger . How does this work ? What would happen if the government no longer regulated quality of food , the maze of airline traffic , and school curriculums ? Would n't we be poisoned , unsafe and , dumber ? [ Ron Paul 's response ] ( URL_5 ) is no , because reputed rating companies would emerge like [ Consumer Reports ] ( URL_2 ) that will tell consumers what is the real deal , and what is simply a scam . These types of companies run on consumer trust , so being honest and sincere is the best way these companies could be profitable . Now , not only do you pay less ( you only pay for the consumer reports you are interested in , not a block of taxes for an entire department ) , but the products are not regulated , meaning that you will have the freedom to purchase more products . He also wants to remove many financial regulations . This is done through repealing two major pieces of legislation . * * Repealing the Dodd - Frank Act * * would mean that many public companies wo n't need to report CEO compensation , that derivative could be traded more freely ( what many pruport to be the cause of the 2008 mortgage crisis ) , and remove institutions created to provide transparency in trading . He wants to * * repeal Sarbanes - Oxley Act * * which largely demands accounting transparency in publicly traded companies to protect investors from another Enron or WorldCom . His rationale is that Dodd - Frank includes a lot of bloat , and increases the responsibilities of the government . His rationale against Sarbanes - Oxley is that it [ discourages companies ] ( URL_8 ) from listing on American stock exchange -- and it 's [ true ] ( URL_1 ) . He wants to also repeal Obama 's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . * * * What 's all this talk about the Federal Reserve ? * * A lot of people are more knowledgeable on monetary policy than I am , so I 'll just go over what he wants to do . He wants to conduct a * * full audit on the Federal Reserve * * . What does this mean ? He tried to see what the Fed was doing last time through the Freedom of Information Act , but the Fed ignored it . Now he wants to pass a law forcing open the Fed 's books by legislating an audit . Why ? He thinks the Federal Reserve is a cartel : an independent group controlling all the money supply . It * enables big government spending * because it can print more of it . It * allows for big bank bailouts * . If you could add more zeros to the amount of money , the money you and I have [ diminishes in value ] ( URL_0 ) ! * * EDIT :* * Will continue adding the other sections , including his positions on taxes , and social issues like abortion , gay marriage , marijuana , and faith later on.
