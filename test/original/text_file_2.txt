So a lot of people think that "The Face on Mars" is an alien type of structure. People say this kind of things because they have no roof that it's a formation just like earth have formations.

I'm here to tell you people that that's a type of formation that Hannes. Like Gavin said it's a type of landform that Hannes in the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. I'm going to tell you why I agree. Us as a NASA team we work hard to solve what it was such as research, scientists working, and our team that spanned the picture. All of us tried to figure out what it was yes we might have thought that it was some type of alien structure but like I said working hard got us where we needed to be. After what we needed to figure out we realized that it wasn't some alien structure using the "Rule of Thumb" we saw the picture 3 times bigger. After we saw that image we automatically realized that it was a simple formation same as what Hannes to earth. Example like what Hansen to Colorado. It used to have a river but after years the water started to evaporate, and it started forming big giant rocks. That's why I don't thing that its some kind of alien structure.
