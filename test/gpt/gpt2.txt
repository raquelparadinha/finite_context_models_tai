Emile Durkheimâ€™s theories on collective effervescence and social solidarity can be used to explain what happens at a sporting event in the United States. Collective effervescence refers to the emotional excitement and energy that is generated when people come together in a group, and this can be seen at a sporting event as fans come together to support their team. This shared enthusiasm creates a sense of unity and belonging among the fans, and can lead to a heightened sense of social solidarity. This solidarity is strengthened by the shared emotions, values and beliefs of the fans, and the shared goal of supporting their team to victory.
