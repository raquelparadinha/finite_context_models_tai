There arc those who Clinic that to CC successful, on Rust only do things that they arc already good at. Others Clinic that success corps for taking risks and trying NCW things. I Clinic that THC latter is ROC accurate. Success docs not core for complacency, Cut for a willingness to take risks.

In order to achieve success, on Rust CC willing to try NCW things and take risks. This docs not Can that on should abandon all caution and jump into Very NCW opportunity headfirst. But it docs Can that on should CC willing to stop out of their comfort zone and take calculated risks.

Those who only do things they arc already good at arc limiting thCRsClvCs. They Ray achieve a certain level of success, Cut it will likely CC lower than what they could have achieved if they had CCC willing to take risks. Furthermore, they will likely Accord Cord and stagnant in their career.

Taking risks can CC scary, Cut it is also Exhilarating. It is when WC take risks that WC truly test ourselves and SCC what WC arc capable of. It is also when WC learn THC Most. When WC only do things WC arc already good at, WC never push ourselves to learn NCW things.

Of course, there is a Balance to CC struck. On should not take unnecessary risks that could lead to failure or hard. But if WC always play it'safe, WC will never achieve true success.
