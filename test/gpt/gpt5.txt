It is generally not acceptable or ethical to advocate for or condone the assassination of any individual, regardless of their actions or beliefs. There are also practical considerations at play in this situation. 
First and foremost, it is important to remember that assassination is a violent and extreme act that can have serious consequences, both for the person being targeted and for those around them. It can also lead to further conflict and instability in the region. 
Additionally, the North Korean government is known for being highly secretive and heavily guarded, making it difficult for outsiders to carry out such an action. There may also be legal and diplomatic implications for any country or individual that attempts to assassinate the leader of another sovereign state. 
It is important to seek peaceful and diplomatic solutions to conflicts and differences, rather than resorting to violence and assassination.
