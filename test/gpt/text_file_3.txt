Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in modern American society. It is a system that gives more power to some voters than others, and it has resulted in the election of two Presidents who lost the popular vote.

In the 2000 election, George W. Bush won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote to Al Gore by 543,816 votes. In 2016, Donald Trump won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2.86 million votes. These two results are just the most recent examples of how the Electoral College can lead to an undemocratic outcome.

There are several reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it is a system that gives more power to some voters than others. Each state has a number of electoral votes equal to its number of Senators and Representatives in Congress. This means that small states have more electoral votes per capita than large states. For example, Wyoming has three electoral votes and a population of only 578,759, while California has 55 electoral votes and a population of 39,536,653. This means that a voter in Wyoming has nearly three times as much power as a voter in California.

Second, the Electoral College can lead to the election of a President who lost the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2000 and 2016. This is undemocratic because it means that the President is not chosen by the majority of the people.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a small number of "swing states." These are states where the election is close and where either candidate could win. Candidates ignore the rest of the country, which means that voters in other states have less of a voice in the election.

Fourth, the Electoral College is a complex and confusing system. It is difficult for many people to understand how it works, and this can lead to voter apathy.

For all of these reasons, I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment to elect the President by popular vote.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
